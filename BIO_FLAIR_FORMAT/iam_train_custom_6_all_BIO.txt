Mr. O
Thorneycroft's B-PERSON
main O
purpose O
will O
be O
to O
remove O
these O
doubts O
, O
and O
to O
persuade O
the O
Federal B-ORGANIZATION
Government I-ORGANIZATION
that O
the O
financial O
burden O
involved O
is O
really O
worth O
while O
, O
at O
a O
time O
when O
any O
increase O
in O
budgetary O
commitments O
would O
almost O
certainly O
involve O
a O
corresponding O
rise O
in O
taxation O
- O
something O
no O
one O
is O
prepared O
to O
contemplate O
in O
an B-TIME
election I-TIME
year I-TIME
. O

But O
, O
at O
the O
same O
time O
, O
there O
is O
reason O
to O
believe O
that O
the O
Federal B-ORGANIZATION
Government I-ORGANIZATION
is O
not O
convinced O
, O
on O
the O
basis O
of O
the O
information O
it O
has O
so O
far O
, O
that O
such O
a O
project O
would O
be O
justified O
from O
a O
scientific O
point O
of O
view O
; O
and O
not O
merely O
constitute O
a O
" O
prestige O
" O
satellite O
, O
duplicating O
to O
some O

American B-NORP
efforts O

On O
the O
specific O
question O
of O
the O
use O
of O
Blue O
Streak O
, O
Mr. O
Thorneycroft's B-PERSON
task O
will O
be O
easier O
. O

He O
can O
point O
out O
that O
this O
is O
the O
only O
rocket O
and O
launcher O
in O
Europe B-LOCATION
to O
have O
reached O
a O
sufficient O
stage O
of O
development O
for O
adaptation O
as O
the O
first B-CARDINAL
stage O
in O
putting O
a O
heavy O
satellite O
into O
outer O
space O
. O

There O
has O
also O
been O
some O
talk O
of O
adopting O
another O
British B-NORP
rocket O
, O
Black O
Knight O
, O
for O
the O
second B-CARDINAL
stage O
, O
but O
the O
French B-NORP
have O
one O
of O
their O
own O
called O
Veronique O
which O
they O
would O
like O
to O
see O
used O
. O

The O
Foreign B-ORGANIZATION
Ministry I-ORGANIZATION
spokesman O
added O
today B-TIME
, O
however O
, O
that O
the O
Brussels B-LOCATION
Treaty O
was O
irrelevant O
, O
because O
research O
on O
the O
various O
rocket O
stages O
had O
already O
been O
concluded O
, O
and O
only O
cooperation O
on O
the O
type O
of O
capsule O
was O
involved O
. O

A O
lesser O
obstacle O
to O
German B-NORP
participation O
is O
the O
absence O
of O
any O
Ministry B-ORGANIZATION
or O
Minister O
directly O
responsible O
for O
it O
- O
and O
therefore O
of O
any O
budget O
under O
which O
funds O
could O
be O
appropriated O
. O

This O
is O
expected O
eventually O
to O
replace O
the O
Fiat B-ORGANIZATION
G-91 O
, O
and O
the O
F O
104 O
Starfighter O
, O
the O

THE O
next O
White O
Paper O
on O
defence O
, O
to O
be O
published O
in O
March B-TIME
, O
is O
likely O
to O
contain O
a O
five-year B-TIME
plan O
for O
the O
three B-ORGANIZATION
Services I-ORGANIZATION
. O

Its O
aim O
will O
be O
to O
produce O
superbly O
equipped O
, O
all-Regular O
forces O
of O
about B-CARDINAL
400,000 I-CARDINAL
men O
. O

The O
three B-ORGANIZATION
Services I-ORGANIZATION
would O
be O
" O
integrated O
" O
to O
a O
greater O
extent O
than O
ever O
before O
. O

The O
scheme O
will O
be O
subject O
to O
Cabinet B-ORGANIZATION
approval O
. O

Mr. O
Watkinson B-PERSON
remains O
con- O
vinced O
that O
the O
policy O
initiated O
in O
1957 B-TIME
, O
in O
Mr. O
Sandys's B-PERSON
time O
as O
Minister O
of O
Defence O
, O
is O
still O
correct O
. O

This O
was O
to O
return O
to O
the O
tradition O
of O
all-Regular O
voluntary O
forces O
, O
with O
the O
last O
National O
Serviceman O
out O
of O
uniform O
by O
the B-TIME
end I-TIME
of I-TIME
1962 I-TIME
. O

The O
Minister O
regards O
the O
recent O
trend O
of O
recruiting O
figures O
as O
encouraging O
. O

He O
is O
confident O
the O
aim O
can O
be O
achieved O
. O

While O
the O
possibility O
of O
an O
eventual O
return O
to O
National O
Service O
in O
some O
form O
cannot O
be O
entirely O
discounted O
, O
he O
does O
not O
agree O
that O
the O
point O
has O
been O
reached O
where O
this O
need O
even O
be O
considered O
. O

If O
National O
Service O
is O
ever O
resorted O
to O
, O
engagement O
would O
probably O
have O
to O
be O
for O
three B-TIME

It O
is O

this O
would O
be O
the O
minimum O
necessary O
for O
the O

Criticisms O
about O

appear O
to O
have O
come O
mainly O
from O
retired O

who O
have O
held O

but O
are O
out O
of O
touch O
with O
the O
existing O
situation O

Mr. O
Watkinson B-PERSON
has O
had O
the O
utmost O
support O
from O
the O
C.I.G.S. B-ORGANIZATION
, O
Field-Marshal O
Sir O

who O

Sir O

Mr. O

Sir O
Francis B-PERSON
is O
to O
hand O

Sir O

from O
Nov. B-TIME

. O

The O
hand-over O
, O
due O
in O
September B-TIME
, O
was O
delayed O
because O
of O
the O
Berlin B-LOCATION
crisis O
. O

Mr. O
Watkinson B-PERSON
and O
his O
advisers O
felt O
the O
change O
would O
be O
unwise O
at O
a O
moment O
 O
when O
attention O
had O
to O
be O
concentrated O
on O
possible O
need O
for O
important O
military O
operations O
. O

For O
this O
reason O
Sir O
Francis B-PERSON
stayed O
on O

and O
 O
sacrificed O
his O
leave O
. O

There O
was O
a O

towards O
the O
Nationalist B-ORGANIZATION

of O
Dr. O

This O
implies O

Early O

Long O
before O

closed O
at O

p.m. I-TIME
it O
was O
evident O
that O
voters O
were O
bored O
by O
the O
Government's B-ORGANIZATION
frequent O
appeals O
to O
the O

The O
election O
was O
the O
fourth B-CARDINAL
in O
four B-TIME
years I-TIME
. O

In O
most O
constituencies O
it O
may O
go O
down O
as O
the O
most O
apathetic O
in O
the O
country's O
history O
. O

THE O
Prime O
Minister O
disclosed O
in O
the O
Commons B-ORGANIZATION
last B-TIME
night I-TIME
that O
he O
had O
considered O
early O
in O
the O
Parliamentary B-ORGANIZATION
recess O
whether O
to O
mobilise O
reserves O
necessary O
to O
bring O
the O
British B-ORGANIZATION
Army I-ORGANIZATION
of I-ORGANIZATION
the I-ORGANIZATION
Rhine I-ORGANIZATION
on O
to O
a O
war O
footing O
. O

He O
decided O
that O
it O
would O
be O
a O
great O
error O
to O
do O
so O
and O
to O
recall O
Parliament B-ORGANIZATION
. O

But O
there O
would O
be O
no O
hesitation O
in O
mobilising O
if O
a O
further O
deterioration O
in O
the O
situation O
warranted O
such O
a O
step O
. O

It O
would O
have O
to O
be O
accompanied O
by O
other O
measures O
of O
a O
military O
, O
economic O
and O
political O
kind O
. O

Mr. O
Macmillan B-PERSON
, O
who O
was O
winding O
up O
the O
foreign O
affairs O
debate O
, O
said O
the O
Government B-ORGANIZATION
could O
not O
be O
party O
to O
accepting O
as O
a O
matter O
of O
principle O
the O
imposed O
division O
of O
Germany B-LOCATION
. O

" O
We O
must O
not O
be O
rattled O
into O
surrender O
, O
but O
we O
must O
not O
- O
and O
I O
am O
not O
- O
be O
afraid O
of O
negotiation O
. O

" O
Mr. O
Godber B-PERSON
, O
Minister O
of O
State O
, O
Foreign B-ORGANIZATION
Office I-ORGANIZATION
, O
said O
earlier O
that O
the O
Government B-ORGANIZATION
had O
asked O
the O
Medical B-ORGANIZATION
Research I-ORGANIZATION
Council I-ORGANIZATION
to O
reassess O
the O
fall-out O
position O
in O
view O
of O
the O
Russian B-NORP
tests O
. O

The O
Council's B-ORGANIZATION
findings O
would O
be O
made O
public O
. O

With O
a O
vigour O
and O
authority O
which O
delighted O
old O
Parliamentary B-ORGANIZATION
friends O
and O
foes O
alike O
, O
the O
Earl O
of O
Avon B-LOCATION
, O
the O
former O
Sir O
Anthony B-PERSON
Eden I-PERSON
, O
in O
his O
maiden O
speech O
in O
the O
House B-ORGANIZATION
of I-ORGANIZATION
Lords I-ORGANIZATION
last B-TIME
night I-TIME
, O
gave O
a O
warning O
that O
 O
appeasement O
over O
Berlin B-LOCATION
could O
only O
lead O
to O
war O
. O

To O
stand O
firm O
, O
he O
declared O
, O
was O
not O
to O
invite O
war O
, O
but O
the O
surest O
way O
to O
avert O
it O
. O

It O
was O
the O
end O
of O
a O
rather O
curious O
speech O
in O
which O
Mr. O
Macmillan B-PERSON
wound O
up O
the O
two-day B-TIME
debate O
on O
foreign O
affairs O
. O

He O
began O
in O
a O
low O
, O
almost O
chatty O
mono- O
tone O
, O
and O
his O
voice O
never O
rose O
to O
any O
accent O
of O
urgency O
. O

He O
passed O
in O
rapid O
review O
the O
United B-ORGANIZATION
Nations I-ORGANIZATION
Secretariat I-ORGANIZATION
; O
nuclear O
tests O
; O
the O
canard O
about O
British B-NORP
interference O
with O
the O
United B-ORGANIZATION
Nations I-ORGANIZATION
in O
the O
Congo B-LOCATION
; O
Kuwait B-LOCATION
; O
and O
South-East B-LOCATION
Asia I-LOCATION
. O

He O
spent O
most O
of O
his O
short O
half-hour B-TIME
on O
Berlin B-LOCATION
. O

He O
deplored O
the O
possibility O
of O
some O
" O
new O
myth O
" O
about O
betrayal O
of O
Germany B-LOCATION
by O
the O
Allies B-NORP
. O

" O
We O
do O
not O
, O
" O
he O
said O
, O
" O
really O
know O
what O
the O
Russians B-NORP
want O
. O

" O
But O
he O
was O
certain O
that O
they O
wanted O
to O
establish O
a O
final O
and O
irrevocable O
division O
of O
Germany B-LOCATION
. O

Britain B-LOCATION
could O
not O
be O
a O
party O
to O
an O
imposed O
division O
. O

But O
negotiation O
, O
as O
the O
debate O
had O
shown O
, O
could O
be O
undertaken O
on O
a O
variety O
of O
bases O
. O

Mr. O
Macmillan B-PERSON
explained O
that O
he O
had O
deliber- O
ately O
refrained O
during O
the O
summer B-TIME
from O
recalling O
Parliament B-ORGANIZATION
or O
ordering O
mobilisation O
by O
proclamation O
, O
such O
as O
would O
be O
necessary O
to O
bring O
the O
British B-ORGANIZATION
Army I-ORGANIZATION
of I-ORGANIZATION
the I-ORGANIZATION
Rhine I-ORGANIZATION
on O
to O
a O
fully O
active O
footing O
. O

That O
would O
have O
created O
a O
thoroughly O
unde- O
sirable O
atmosphere O
of O
panic O
. O

He O
thought O
that O
the O
situation O
was O
rather O
more O
hopeful O
. O

The O
Russians B-NORP
now O
realised O
its O
seriousness O
. O

The O
French B-NORP
doubts O
were O
more O
about O
procedure O
than O
about O
substance O
. O

The O
Prime O
Minister's O
attitude O
of O
studied O
calm O
brought O
down O
the O
temperature O
of O
the O
debate O
, O
which O
never O
at O
any O
time O
rose O
to O
fever O
pitch O
, O
to O
a O
remarkable O
degree O
of O
sub-normality O
. O

Throughout O
Mr. O
Macmillan's B-PERSON
speech O
the O
Earl O
of O
Home B-PERSON
, O
Foreign O
Secretary O
, O
was O
listening O
in O
the O
Peers' B-LOCATION
Gallery I-LOCATION
. O

The O
early O
speakers O
in O
the O
debate O
each O
severely O
rated O
the O
speech O
of O
his O
predecessor O
. O

These O
strictures O
were O
all O
too O
well O
justified O
. O

We O
started O
with O
the O
plaintive O
wailings O
of O
Mr. O
Healey B-PERSON
, O
" O
Shadow O
" O
Foreign O
Secretary O
, O
described O
by O
Mr. O
Godber B-PERSON
, O
Minister O
of O
State O
, O
Foreign B-ORGANIZATION
Office I-ORGANIZATION
, O
as O
" O
pedantic O
and O
obscure O
on O
Berlin B-LOCATION
, O
damaging O
and O
obscure O
on O
the O
Congo B-LOCATION
. O

" O
In O
turn O
, O
Mr. O
Godber B-PERSON
was O
censured O
by O
Mr. O
Shinwell B-PERSON
, O
former O
Labour B-ORGANIZATION
Defence O
Minister O
, O
for O
having O
read O
the O
The O
trouble O
about O
such O
debates O
is O
that O
they O
range O
too O
widely O
. O

They O
remind O
one O
of O
the O
Rugby O
match O
in O
" O
Tom B-PERSON
Brown's I-PERSON
Schooldays O
, O
" O
in O
which O
all O
the O
boys O
were O
welcome O
to O
take O
part O
, O
and O
only O
those O
who O
" O
really O
meant O
business O
" O
removed O
their O
jackets O
. O

Not O
many O
metaphorical O
braces O
were O
visible O
in O
the O
early O
stages O
of O
to-night's B-TIME
debate O
. O

Mr. O
Healey B-PERSON
had O
another O
tilt O
at O
the O
Prime O
Minister's O
golf-course O
Press O
conference O
, O
which O
he O
described O
as O
" O
a O
display O
of O
flabby O
and O
A O
reference O
to O
the O
reunification O
of O
Germany B-LOCATION
brought O
a O
bark O
of O
" O
Start O
another O
war O
! O

" O
from O
Mr. O
Ellis B-PERSON
Smith I-PERSON
( O
Lab. B-ORGANIZATION
, O
Stoke B-LOCATION
on I-LOCATION
Trent I-LOCATION
S. I-LOCATION
) O
. O

Then O
Mr. O
Healey B-PERSON
launched O
out O
on O
his O
pet O
theme O
of O
limitation O
of O
armaments O
in O
Europe B-LOCATION
. O

This O
could O
, O
he O
suggested O
, O
be O
linked O
with O
prohibition O
of O
the O
production O
of O
atomic O
weapons O
in O
any O
part O
of O
Europe B-LOCATION
. O

Inspection O
and O
control O
would O
be O
much O
easier O
to O
establish O
in O
these O
territories O
. O

Mr. O
Healey B-PERSON
denounced O
the O
Government B-ORGANIZATION
for O
using O
double O
standards O
. O

Ministers O
had O
rebuked O
the O
unaligned O
nations O
for O
not O
condemning O
the O
new O
Russian B-NORP
tests O
, O
but O
they O
themselves O
had O
no O
condemnation O
for O
events O
in O
Angola B-LOCATION
or O
Algeria B-LOCATION
. O

It O
was O
not O
for O
the O
Government B-ORGANIZATION
, O
said O
Mr. O
Healey B-PERSON
, O
to O
take O
up O
moral O
attitudes O
, O
" O
especially O
when O
the O
temple O
of O
their O
religion O
is O
the O
bingo-parlour O
. O

" O
This O
puzzled O
such O
students O
of O
comparative O
religion O
as O
had O
failed O
to O
detect O
this O
cult O
. O

But O
Mr. O
Healey B-PERSON
had O
a O
partial O
and O
limited O
success O
. O

He O
rallied O
behind O
him O
the O
Left-wing O
opinion O
so O
coolly O
snubbed O
last B-TIME
night I-TIME
by O
his O
leader O
, O
Mr. O
Gaitskell B-PERSON
. O

Mr. O
Godber's B-PERSON
performance O
merited O
all O
the O
mild O
scorn O
heaped O
on O
it O
by O
Mr. O
Shinwell B-PERSON
. O

True O
, O
he O
did O
tell O
the O
House B-ORGANIZATION
that O
the O
Government B-ORGANIZATION
had O
asked O
the O
Medical B-ORGANIZATION
Research I-ORGANIZATION
Council I-ORGANIZATION
to O
reassess O
the O
fall-out O
position O
in O
view O
of O
the O
Russian B-NORP
tests O
, O
and O
said O
that O
the O
council's B-ORGANIZATION
findings O
would O
be O
published O
. O

He O
was O
not O
so O
happy O
in O
his O
defence O
of O
the O
Government's B-ORGANIZATION
failure O
to O
condemn O
France B-LOCATION
for O
her O
nuclear O
tests O
in O
the O
Sahara B-LOCATION
on O
the O
grounds O
that O
they O
were O
only O
little O
ones O
. O

This O
was O
too O
reminiscent O
of O
the O
nursemaid O
and O
her O
illegitimate O
baby O
. O

For O
the O
most O
part O
, O
Mr. O
Godber B-PERSON
muttered O
his O
way O
through O
a O
cliche-ridden O
Foreign B-ORGANIZATION
Office I-ORGANIZATION
brief O
. O

He O
resembles O
the O
elephant O
seal O
, O
an O
 O
otherwise O
endearing O
creature O
whose O
articulation O
is O
limited O
, O
we O
are O

to O
a O
series O
of O
heavy O
sighs O

Mr. O

attack O
had O
, O
if O
anything O
, O
rallied O
support O
to O
the O
Prime O

. O

This O
apparently O
, O
was O
Mr. O
Macmillan's B-PERSON
assessment O
. O

He O
confined O
his O
reply O
to O
the O
observation O
that O
Mr. O
Fell B-PERSON
had O
probably O
" O
maximised O
his O
support O
. O

" O
There O
were O
no O
other O
attacks O
of O
such O
ferocity O
. O

But O
there O
was O
ample O
evidence O
of O
Conservative B-ORGANIZATION

opposition O
, O
which O
will O
be O
aired O
in O
the O
debate O
tomorrow B-TIME

He O
claimed O
that O

we O

" O

he O
said O

Mr. O

with O
the O
main O
objection O

Mr. O

speaks O
out O
in O
revulsion O

the O
South B-ORGANIZATION
African I-ORGANIZATION

we O
wait O
for O
the O

the O

Will O
it O

The O
issue O
is O

There O
is O
a O
possibility O
that O
it O

may O

A O
CURIOUS O
advertisement O
on O
page O
nine B-CARDINAL
, O
paid O
for O
by O
that O
curious O
body O
Moral B-ORGANIZATION
Re-Armament I-ORGANIZATION
. O

Those O
who O
lend O
their O
names O
to O
this O
kind O
of O
advertisement O
are O
worthy O
people O
, O
a O
little O
innocent O
of O
politics O
, O
perhaps O
, O
or O
carried O
away O
by O
the O
idea O
that O
moral O
regeneration O
would O
solve O
all O
our O
problems O
. O

So O
it O
would O
. O

While O
we O
are O
waiting O
for O
the O
millenium B-TIME
, O
however O
, O
most O
of O
us O
would O
prefer O
to O
put O
our O
hopes O
for O
earthly O
justice O
in O
instruments O
of O
democracy O
, O
such O
as O
trade O
unions O
and O
our O
local O
and O
national O
Parliaments B-ORGANIZATION
. O

Should O
the O
Herald B-ORGANIZATION
publish O
such O
advertisements O
? O

This O
is O
a O
difficult O
question O
. O

It O
would O
obviously O
be O
wrong O
to O
refuse O
all O
political O
advertisements O
with O
which O
we O
disagree O
. O

When O
an O
advertisement O
contains O
statements O
whose O
factual O
truth O
is O
doubtful O
, O
or O
where O
the O
total O
content O
would O
be O
deeply O
repugnant O
to O
our O
readers O
, O
it O
is O
right O
to O
exercise O
editorial O
discretion O
. O

The O
MRA B-ORGANIZATION
advertisement O
falls O
into O
neither O
category O
, O
though O
many O
readers O
will O
dislike O
it O
. O

The O
first B-CARDINAL
reaction O
of O
the O
Sudanese B-ORGANIZATION
Government I-ORGANIZATION
was O
to O
denounce O
the O
United B-ORGANIZATION
Nations I-ORGANIZATION
for O
" O
negligence O
and O
impotence O
, O
" O
and O
to O
say O
that O
its O
400 B-CARDINAL
troops O
in O
the O
Congo B-LOCATION
would O
be O
taken O
home O
. O

The O
reaction O
can O
be O
understood O
. O

The O
Sudan's B-LOCATION
concern O
for O
its O
men O
is O
natural O
. O

But O
this O
could O
hardly O
be O
a O
 O
dignified O
exit O
. O

IF O
the O
UN B-ORGANIZATION
is O
blamed O
for O
being O
weak O
, O
it O
would O
be O
more O
logical O
to O
send O
in O
more O
men O
, O
not O
weaken O
it O
further O
by O
desertion O
. O

It O
is O
unjust O
to O
pass O
the O
buck O
to O
Mr. O
Hammarskjold B-PERSON
and O
the O
UN's B-ORGANIZATION
servants O
. O

The O
responsibility O
rightly O
belongs O
to O
the O
nations O
which O
have O
undertaken O
the O
task O
of O
pre- O
serving O
peace O
in O
the O
Congo B-LOCATION
. O

That O
is O
not O
a O
ceremonial O
duty O
, O
and O
the O
soldiers O
have O
every O
right O
to O
blame O
the O
politicians O
unless O
they O
see O
it O
through O
. O

When O
the O
United B-ORGANIZATION
Nations I-ORGANIZATION
instructed O
Mr. O
Hammarskjold B-PERSON
to O
use O
force O
if O
necessary O
to O
prevent O
civil O
war O
, O
it O
was O
clear O
that O
new O
dangers O
would O
arise O
unless O
it O
gave O
him O
the O
political O
... O
That O
was O
the O
first B-CARDINAL
point O
that O
Mr. O
Hammarskjold B-PERSON
made O
. O

India B-LOCATION
has O
responded O
handsomely O
by O
providing O
3,000 B-CARDINAL
men O
, O
who O
must O
take O
about B-TIME
a I-TIME
fortnight I-TIME
to O
arrive O
. O

If O
the O
UN B-ORGANIZATION
forces O
were O
thick O
enough O
on O
the O
ground O
, O
such O
incidents O
as O
that O
at O
Matadi B-LOCATION
would O
not O
happen O
. O

THE O
UN's B-ORGANIZATION
ability O
to O
keep O
peace O
depends O
simply O
on O
adequate O
support O
by O
the O
nations O
which O
have O
set O
their O
hands O
to O
this O
plough O
. O

The O
big O
Powers O
involved O
in O
the O
Cold O
War O
must O
of O
course O
keep O
out O
. O

The O
Americans B-NORP
were O
justified O
in O
diverting O
naval O
ships O
in O
case O
non-combatant O
help O
was O
wanted O
; O
but O
they O
stressed O
that O
there O
was O
no O
intention O
to O
intervene O
in O
fighting O
. O

Yesterday B-TIME
the O
ships O
turned O
away O
again O
, O
satisfied O
that O
they O
were O
not O
required O
. O

It O
is O
to O
be O
hoped O
that O
the O
UN B-ORGANIZATION
will O
be O
re-established O
in O
their O
port O
by O
negotiation O
and O
that O
there O
will O
be O
no O
more O
outrages O
. O

But O
back O
, O
Mr. O
Hammarskjold B-PERSON
is O
determined O
, O
they O
must O
go O
. O

The O
best O
news O
for O
the O
Congo B-LOCATION
would O
be O
agreement O
between O
its O
rival O
political O
leaders O
. O

Through O
the O
patient O
efforts O
of O
UN B-ORGANIZATION
conciliators O
they O
are O
meeting O
for O
the O
first B-CARDINAL
time O
, O
in O
Malagasy B-LOCATION
( O
formerly O
Madagascar B-LOCATION
) O
. O

THE O
world O
will O
sigh O
with O
relief O
when O
this O
strife-torn O
land O
gets O
itself O
a O
government O
which O
all O
outsiders O
can O
recognise O
. O

ONLY O
a O
man O
wrapped O
in O
the O
impenetrable O
cocoon O
of O
what O
he O
regards O
as O
a O
divine O
mission O
could O
have O
spoken O
of O
apartheid O
as O
" O
a O
policy O
of O
good O
neighbourliness O
. O

" O
We O
may O
be O
sure O
that O
he O
is O
not O
being O
hypocritical O

That O
is O
what O
he O
really O
believes O
. O

A O
good O
neighbour O
to O
those O
Africans B-NORP
who O
, O
under O
apartheid O

will O
be O
forced O
back O
to O
their O
tribal O
reserves O
with O
no O

a O
cramped O

primitive O
existence O

A O
good O

to O
those O

who O
will O
con- O
tinue O
to O
live O
as O
hewers O
of O

in O
the O
white O
areas O
of O
South B-LOCATION
Africa I-LOCATION
, O
without O

and O
without O

THE O
same O
sort O
of O
good O

that O
he O
proved O
to O
be O
to O
the O
Jews B-NORP
fleeing O
from O
Hitler B-PERSON
in O
the B-TIME

It O
was O
Dr. O

who O
led O
a O
protest O
against O
admitting O
any O

them O
because O
they O
would O
" O

the O

It O
is O
impossible O
to O
make O
contact O
with O
Dr. O
Ver- B-PERSON
woerd I-PERSON
in O
his O
nightmare O
world O
. O

It O
is O
this O
that O
makes O
illusory O
any O
hopes O
that O
he O
may O
be O
in- O
fluenced O
to O
change O
course O

The O
Archbishop O
of O
Capetown B-LOCATION
, O
Dr. O
Joost B-PERSON
de I-PERSON
Blank I-PERSON
, O
has O
pleaded O
that O
South B-LOCATION
Africa I-LOCATION
should O
be O
allowed O
to O
stay O
in O
the O
Commonwealth B-ORGANIZATION
. O

Otherwise O
, O
he O
says O
, O
those O
inside O
the O
country O
who O
still O
oppose O
apartheid O
will O
be O
left O
even O
more O
isolated O
and O
alone O

The O
views O
of O

who O
has O
maintained O
an O
unflinching O
witness O
to O
what O
Christianity B-ORGANIZATION
really O
means O

must O
carry O
weight O

But O
what O
, O
in O
fact O
, O
can O
the O
other O
Commonwealth B-ORGANIZATION
countries O
do O
to O
bring O
support O
and O
comfort O
to O
this O
gallant O
minority O
? O

THERE O
is O
no O
evidence O
that O
the O
policy O
of O
appeasement O
has O
modified O
the O
actions O
of O
the O
Nationalists B-NORP
. O

On O
the O
contrary O
, O
apartheid O
is O
being O
applied O
ever O
more O
ruthlessly O
. O

The O
shock O
of O
expulsion O
from O
the O
Commonwealth B-ORGANIZATION
now O
seems O
to O
be O
the O
only O
way O
left O
to O
try O
to O
bring O
home O
to O
the O
people O
of O
South B-LOCATION
Africa I-LOCATION
that O
Dr. O
Verwoerd B-PERSON
is O
leading O
them O
to O

It O
may O
be O
that O
the O
Commonwealth B-ORGANIZATION
Prime O
Ministers O
will O
decide O
against O
this O
final O
step O

If O
that O
is O
their O
decision O
they O
should O
also O
go O
unequivocally O
on O
record O
that O
they O
regard O
apartheid O
as O
evil O

indefensible O
. O

Unless O
they O
do O
at O

that O

Dr. O

will O
be O

 O
to O

the O
extraordinary O

Not O
content O
with O
arguing O
that O
he O
was O
only O
an O

tested O

not O
found O
wanting O

" O
He O
feels O
like O
Pontius B-PERSON
Pilate I-PERSON
who O
washed O
his O

before O
the O

saying O
: O
" O
I O

" O
Like O
Dr. O
Globke B-PERSON
, O
whom O
I O
interviewed O
the O

Eichmann B-PERSON
said O
: O
" O
I O
drew O

that O
I O
did O
what O
I O
could O
despite O
my O
low O

" O
Eichmann B-PERSON
is O
on O
dangerous O
ground O
when O
he O
pleads O
that O
he O
was O
only O
a O

of O
the O

every O

in O
the O
chain O
of O
command O
that O
led O
to O
the O

He O
understood O
the O

apparatus O

an O

comprehension O
that O

used O
it O
with O
power O

The O
appalling O
thing O
about O
the O
Germans B-NORP
is O
that O
they O

them- O

a O

Not O
that O

I O
AM O
happy O

that O
I O
saw O
some- O
thing O
this B-TIME

I O
have O
never O
before O
witnessed O

either O
in O

a O

playing O
a O

scene O
, O
and O
playing O
it O
with O
perfect O

It O
gives O
one B-CARDINAL
loud O
, O
clear O
hiccup O
and O
falls O
flat O
on O
its O
back O
. O

This O
brilliant O
budge O
, O
I O
may O
add O
, O
gets O
no O
credit O
in O
the O

of O
Come O

The O

ON O
a O
March B-TIME
evening I-TIME
in O
1932 B-TIME
in O
the O
New B-LOCATION
Jersey I-LOCATION
family O
household O
the O
nursemaid O
tiptoed O
into O
the O
baby's O
room O
to O
see O
that O
20-month-old B-TIME
Charles B-PERSON
Jun. I-PERSON
was O
sleeping O
. O

Bending O
over O
the O
cot O
, O
she O
suddenly O
realised O
that O
there O
was O
no O
sound O
of O
breathing O
. O

She O
thrust O
out O
her O
hand O
- O
and O
felt O
emptiness O
. O

A B-TIME
FEW I-TIME
minutes I-TIME
later I-TIME
the O
father O
gripping O
a O
loaded O
rifle O
, O
told O
his O
wife O
: O
Against O
these O
advantages O
the O
codex O
was O
fragile O
and O
might O
be O
bulky O
. O

It O
is O
sometimes O
possible O
to O
tell O
whether O
or O
not O
a O
particular O
text O
was O
written O
on O
a O
roll O
or O
a O
codex O
. O

Rolls O
were O
prepared O
for O
writing O
, O
but O
any O
papyrus O
left O
unused O
at O
the O
end O
could O
be O
cut O
off O
. O

If O
the O
text O
was O
longer O
than O
the O
roll O
, O
a O
sheet O
could O
easily O
be O
glued O
on O
. O

The O
verso O
of O
the O
roll O
was O
blank O
, O
and O
one O
cannot O
think O
of O
an O
author O
, O
Mark B-PERSON
for O
example O
, O
sending O
out O
his O
Gospel O
lacking O
the O
ending O
, O
while O
one O
whole O
side O
of O
his O
roll O
was O
unused O
. O

The O
codex O
form O
was O
not O
so O
accommodating O
. O

Even O
in O
the O
case O
of O
the O
single-sheet O
quire O
, O
an O
extra O
sheet O
glued O
on O
might O
have O
to O
be O
gummed O
on O
over O
the O
binding O
, O
or O
the O
whole O
codex O
rebound O
. O

According O
to O
the O
legend O
, O
Solomon B-PERSON
had O
asked O
the O
Prince O
of O
the O
Demons O
, O
" O
Ashmodeus B-PERSON
" O
to O
bring O
him O
the O
Shamir O
and O
Ashmodeus B-PERSON
told O
him O
that O
the O
Shamir O
had O
not O
been O
placed O
under O
his O
charge O
, O
as O
there O
is O
no O
Shamir O
in O
Gehenna B-LOCATION
( O
Hell B-LOCATION
) O
. O

An O
eagle O
brought O
the O
Shamir O
to O
Solomon B-PERSON
from O
Eden B-LOCATION
, O
the O
Paradise B-LOCATION
, O
the O
only O
place O
where O
the O
Shamir O
could O
be O
found O
. O

The O
Talmud O
describes O
that O
the O
Shamir O
lives O
in O
a O
sanctuary O
, O
and O
only O
some O
rare O
birds O
know O
the O
existence O
of O
it O
. O

These O
birds O
are O
, O
the O
Cherubim O
and O
the O
Seraphim O
. O

We O
are O
also O
told O
that O
the O
Shamir O
is O
the O
stylus O
used O
by O
Moses B-PERSON
, O
and O
this O
stylus O
is O
described O
as O
a O
very O
precious O
diamond-stone O
and O
very O
adamant O
. O

And O
you O
serve O
Mammon O
and O
God O
. O

And O
you O
cannot O
serve O
two B-CARDINAL
masters O
, O
and O
you O
worship O
self-interest O
, O
isolating O
yourself O
, O
under O
such O
conditions O
the O
goods O
are O
your O
gods O
. O

" O
And O
then O
the O
Lord's O
wrath O
be O
kindled O
against O
you O
, O
and O
he O
shut O
up O
the O
heavens O
, O
that O
there O
is O
no O
rain O
, O
and O
that O
the O
land O
yield O
not O
her O
fruit O
and O
lest O
1ye O
perish O
quickly O
from O
off O
the O
good O
land O
which O
the O
Lord O
1giveth O
you O
. O

" O
For O
without O
the O
vision O
to O
serve O
the O
Lord O
your O
God O
with O
all O
your O
heart O
and O
with O
all O
your O
soul O
and O
with O
all O
your O
might O
the O
problem O
of O
life O
cannot O
be O
solved O
. O

" O
Therefore O
shall O
1ye O
lay O
up O
these O
my O
words O
in O
your O
heart O
and O
in O
your O
soul O
. O

The O
text O
adds O
and O
in O
your O

searching O

Ben B-PERSON

that O
when O

" O
we O

The B-TIME
new I-TIME
century I-TIME
opened O
with O
James B-PERSON
1 I-PERSON
ascending O
the O
throne O
. O

He O
was O
quite O
prepared O
to O
be O
tolerant O
towards O
Rome B-LOCATION
though O
the O
Gunpowder O
Plot O
spoiled O
that O
. O

The O
Puritans B-NORP
had O
high O
hopes O
, O
for O
James B-PERSON
had O
grown O
up O
in O
Presbyterian B-NORP
Scotland B-LOCATION
, O
but O
those O
hopes O
were O
dashed O
. O

True O
, O
a O
new O
Prayer O
Book O
was O
issued O
in O
1604 B-TIME
but O
the O
Puritans B-NORP
derived O
little O
comfort O
from O
it O
. O

This O
indicated O
how O
ephemeral O
in O
the O
Church B-ORGANIZATION
had O
been O
the O
mood O
which O
produced O
the O
Black O
Rubric O
, O
for O
it O
says O
that O
' O
the O
Body O
and O
Blood O
of O
Christ B-PERSON
, O
which O
are O
verily O
and O
indeed O
taken O
and O
received O
by O
the O
faithful O
in O
the O
Lord's O
Supper O
. O

' O
It O
could O
hardly O
be O
more O
definite O
. O

It O
was O
at O
this O
time O
, O
too O
, O
that O
King O
James B-PERSON
made O
himself O
immortal O
by O
becoming O
associated O
with O
a O
Bible O
translation O
- O
the O
Authorized O
Version O
( O
which O
was O
never O
actually O
authorized O
! O

) O
. O

In O
that O
year O
Shakespeare B-PERSON
had O
just O
turned O
forty B-TIME
and O
had O
written O
Hamlet B-PERSON
two B-TIME
years I-TIME
before I-TIME
. O

Bacon B-PERSON
was O
at O
work O
and O
Milton B-PERSON
was O
just O
learning O
to O
read O
. O

James B-PERSON
was O
followed O
by O
Charles B-PERSON
, O
in O
whose O
reign O
came O
the O
Scottish B-NORP
Prayer O
Book O
in O
1637 B-TIME
. O

Significantly O
this O
made O
a O
deliberate O
return O
to O
the O
Book O
of O
1549 B-TIME
and O
became O
the O
foster O
mother O
of O
some O
of O
the O
most O
important O
Prayer O
Books O
in O
the O
Anglican B-ORGANIZATION
Communion I-ORGANIZATION
. O

Forever O
associated O
with O
Charles B-PERSON
is O
Archbishop O
Laud B-PERSON
, O
now O
so O
much O
nobler O
a O
figure O
than O
former O
historians O
led O
us O
to O
believe O
. O

Laud B-PERSON
was O
enthusiastically O
hated O
by O
Calvinists B-NORP
and O
Puritans B-NORP
, O
and O
the O
sentiment O
was O
mutual O
. O

But O
Laud B-PERSON
was O
no O
Romanizer O
. O

One B-CARDINAL
of O
his O
first B-CARDINAL
public O
acts O
was O
a O
hard-hitting O
battle O
with O
the O
Jesuit B-NORP
, O
Fisher B-PERSON
. O

But O
anyone O
who O
was O
friendly O
with O
James B-PERSON
and O
Charles B-PERSON
, O
the O
Puritans B-NORP
argued O
, O
was O
necessarily O
a O
menace O
. O

In O
the O
first B-CARDINAL
place O
it O
is O
not O
a O
great O
deal O
of O
use O
telling O
even O
children O
, O
as O
I O
have O
already O
suggested O
, O
not O
to O
be O
silly O
or O
to O
pull O
themselves O
together O
. O

Far O
better O
to O
help O
them O
to O
face O
whatever O
it O
is O
that O
is O
worrying O
them O
, O
to O
find O
the O
original O
cause O
and O
then O
deal O
with O
it O
; O
show O
it O
up O
either O
for O
the O
sham O
it O
is O
- O
and O
many O
fears O
are O
based O
upon O
completely O
irrational O
pre-conceived O
notions O
- O
or O
to O
Even O
worse O
is O
to O
laugh O
. O

Tremendous O
damage O
may O
be O
done O
to O
a O
child O
by O
laughing O
at O
what O
are O
very O
real O
fears O
. O

As O
adults O
, O
we O
know O
that O
their O
fears O
are O
groundless O
, O
indeed O
to O
us O
they O
appear O
laughable O
, O
but O
to O
a O
child O
they O
are O
very O
real O
. O

Not O
that O
I O
am O
suggesting O
that O
children O
should O
be O
molly-coddled O
- O
they O
must O
be O
made O
to O
face O
their O
fears O
, O
to O
see O
through O
them O
and O
come O
out O
on O
the O
other O
side O
as O
victors O
. O

Because O
situations O
which O
may O
contain O
all O
the O
elements O
of O
fear O
can O
arise O
suddenly O
, O
it O
is O
a O
good O
idea O
to O
condition O
a O
child O
to O
some O
extent O
against O
it O
. O

To O
keep O
a O
child O
of O
twelve B-CARDINAL
or O
thirteen B-CARDINAL
under O
the O
impression O
that O
nothing O
nasty O
ever O
happens O
is O
not O
merely O
dishonest O
, O
it O
is O
unwise O
. O

As O
I O
shall O
suggest O
in O
a O
later O
chapter O
there O
are O
some O
situations O
which O
occur O
less O
frequently O
than O
... O
Today B-TIME
A O
wonderful O
thought O
In O
the O
dawn O
was O
given O

the O
thought O
Was O
this O
: O
That O
a O
secret O
plan O
Is O
hid O
in O
my O

; O
That O
my O
hand O
is O
big O
Big O
, O
Because O
of O
the O

That O
God O

Who O

who O
experienced O
all O

emotion O

and O
whose O
sensitive O
nature O
knows O
better O
than O
we O
do O
, O
what O
it O
is O
to O
be O
really O
afraid O
, O
help O
us O
to O
know O
that O
when O
we O
face O
life O
boldly O
, O
many O
of O
the O
shadows O
are O
seen O
to O
be O
allies O
and O
not O
enemies O
and O
that O
, O
come O
what O
may O
, O
we O
are O
never O
alone O
when O
we O
are O
with O
Thee O
. O

To O
others O
, O
the O
long O
hours O
of O
the O
night B-TIME
bring O
only O
a O
disturbed O
tossing O
and O
turning O
which O
causes O
them O
to O
wake O
feeling O
worse O
than O
when O
they O
went O
to O
bed O
. O

We O
may O
begin O
to O
understand O
this O
a O
little O
better O
when O
we O
realize O
that O
tiredness O
itself O
is O
largely O
in O
the O
mind O
. O

Very O
few O
people O
, O
under O
normal O
conditions O
, O
work O
themselves O
to O
a O
standstill O
. O

The O
mind O
tires O
first B-CARDINAL
and O
conveys O
the O
impression O
of O
tiredness O
to O
the O
body O
. O

This O
can O
be O
proved O
by O
noting O
the O
effect O
of O
a O
new O
stimulus O
on O
some- O
body O
who O
feels O
thoroughly O
tired O
. O

Suppose O
a O
mother O
has O
news O
late B-TIME
at I-TIME
night I-TIME
that O
her O
child O
is O
in O
danger O
. O

She O
will O
undertake O
a O
journey O
which O
, O
an B-TIME
hour I-TIME
before O
, O
she O
would O
have O
declared O
impossible O
. O

They O
drag O
themselves O
around O
and O
can O
become O
a O
burden O
to O
their O
families O
and O
their O
friends O
. O

Any O
mental O
confusion O
can O
cause O
this O
and O
the O
best O
way O
is O
probably O
to O
seek O
advice O
. O

As O
we O
are O
unable O
to O
cure O
our O
own O
bodies O
if O
the O
cause O
of O
our O
pain O
is O
too O
deep O
seated O
, O
so O
we O
are O
unable O
to O
cure O
our O
own O
minds O
, O
if O
the O
trouble O
is O
a O
complicated O
one O
involving O
careful O
and O
patient O
treatment O
. O

One B-CARDINAL
of O
the O
greatest O
steps O
forward O
that O
has O
been O
made O
this B-TIME
century I-TIME
is O
the O
way O
in O
which O
illness O
of O
the O
mind O
is O
no O
longer O
feared O
or O
shunned O
, O
and O
is O
in O
fact O
no O
differently O
regarded O
than O
physical O
illness O
. O

There O
is O
, O
nevertheless O
, O
a O
great O
deal O
of O
tiredness O
which O
comes O
from O
no O
major O
complication O
but O
results O
from O
an O
inability O
to O
deal O
with O
life O
, O
especially O
under O
the O
diverse O
pattern O
which O
is O
the B-TIME
twentieth I-TIME
century I-TIME
. O

In O
other O
ways O
, O
too O
, O
life O
for O
the O
ordinary O
individual O
has O
become O
so O
complex O
that O
it O
taxes O
the O
mind O
. O

Two B-TIME
hundred I-TIME
years I-TIME
ago I-TIME
, O
men O
lived O
and O
worked O
in O
one B-CARDINAL
place O
, O
their O
lives O
were O
of O
one B-CARDINAL
piece O
. O

Now O
a O
man O
may O
live O
twenty B-CARDINAL
, O
thirty B-CARDINAL
even O
sixty B-CARDINAL
miles O
from O
his O
work O
. O

The O
only O
connexion O
is O
the O
pipeline O
of O
the O
railway O
on O
which O
they O
travel O
day O
by O
day O
. O

In O
many O
cases O
, O
their O
homes O
know O
little O
of O
their O
place O
of O
work O
and O
their O
associates O
at O
the O
office O
or O
works O
wonder O
what O
they O
are O
possibly O
like O
in O
the O
surroundings O
of O
their O
homes O
. O

It O
is O
easy O
, O
desperately O
easy O
, O
to O
lead O
a O
' O
double O
' O
life O
without O
ever O
deliberately O
planning O
to O
do O
so O
or O
in O
fact O
being O
conscious O
of O
what O
is O
going O
on O
. O

It O
is O
easier O
to O
live O
life O
in O
compartments O
but O
over O
the O
years O
it O
builds O
up O
, O
and O
to O
do O
so O
inevitably O
builds O
up O
tensions O
which O
need O
to O
be O
handled O
correctly O
. O

Can O
we O
then O
frame O
some O
' O
rules O
' O
which O
may O
enable O
us O
to O
live O
life O
as O
fully O
as O
possible O
, O
without O
having O
our O
energy O
sapped O
by O
un- O
necessary O
weariness O
. O

( O
a O
) O
Order O
makes O
for O
a O
decrease O
in O
tiredness O
. O

We O
have O
a O
saying O
' O
My O
head O
will O
never O
save O
my O
feet O
' O
. O

Time O
after O
time O
we O
forget O
something O
and O
have O
to O
go O
back O
upstairs O
or O
down O
to O
the O
shops O
. O

The O
housewife O
would O
find O
life O
far O
less O
tiring O
if O
she O
made O
a O
list O
, O
followed O
a O
routine O
of O
work O
rather O
than O
getting O
from O
one O
thing O
to O
the O
next O
. O

The O
business O
man O
would O
find O
that O
he O
reached O
the B-TIME
end I-TIME
of I-TIME
the I-TIME
day I-TIME
with O
far O
less O
strain O
if O
he O
was O
a O
little O
more O
systematic O
. O

To O
drift O
aimlessly O
along O
is O
more O
wearying O
than O
any- O
thing O
else O
. O

If O
we O
would O
only O
sit O
down O
and O
write O
out O
all O
the O
necessary O
jobs O
waiting O
to O
be O
done O
and O
then O
work O
quietly O
through O
them O
, O
we O
would O
find O
life O
considerably O
less O
exhausting O
There O
may O
be O
some O
who O
will O
argue O
that O
routine O
destroys O
the O
soul O
. O

It O
is O
so O
easy O
, O
they O
say O
, O
to O
get O
into O
a O
rut O
. O

Save O
us O
from O
the O
school O
curriculum O
and O
even O
worse O
the O
school O
system O
whereby O
for O
meals O
everybody O
knows O
beforehand O
exactly O
what O
, O
on O
any O
given O
day O
of O
the O
week O
, O
they O
are O
going O
to O
have O
. O

If O
- O
such O
a O
critic O
may O
say O
- O
you O
are O
calling O
us O
to O
adventure O
, O
do O
not O
strangle O
us O
before O
we O
start O
by O
putting O
us O
into O
a O
strait-jacket O
I O
am O
more O
than O
conscious O
of O
this O
. O

How O
anybody O
can O
go O
through O
the O
same O
routine O
day O
in O
and O
day O
out O
for O
forty B-TIME
years I-TIME
I O
find O
difficult O
to O
understand O
. O

A O
lot O
of O
it O
is O
inevitable O
so O
that O
industry O
and O
commerce O
may O
be O
kept O
going O
- O
though O
if O
ever O
it O
becomes O
possible O
to O
work O
out O
a O
system O
of O
' O
staggered O
' O
hours O
it O
may O
do O
an O
immense O
amount O
of O
good O
over O
and O
above O
relieving O
the O
pressure O
on O
over-crowded O
trains O
. O

As O
it O
is O
, O
with O
so O
much O
of O
our O
life O
already O
in O
a O
predetermined O
groove O
, O
I O
would O
hardly O
like O
to O
add O
further O
to O
the O
dullness O
which O
it O
engenders O
. O

But O
I O
am O
not O
arguing O
for O
this O
. O

I O
know O
how O
much O
of O
a O
drag O
it O
can O
be O
and O
I O
was O
interested O
some O
little O
while O
ago O
to O
hear O
of O
a O
school O
who O
tried O
a O
six- B-TIME
day I-TIME
timetable O
. O

They O
only O
worked O
, O
of O
course O
, O
a B-TIME
five- I-TIME
day I-TIME
week I-TIME
so O
that O
in O
the B-TIME
first I-TIME
week I-TIME
Monday I-TIME
to I-TIME
Friday I-TIME
were O
days O
one B-CARDINAL
to O
five B-CARDINAL
of O
the O
timetable O
, O
the B-TIME
following I-TIME
Monday I-TIME
was O
day B-TIME
six I-TIME
and O
Tuesday B-TIME
started O
day B-TIME
one I-TIME
again O
and O
so O
on O
. O

By O
this O
means O
they O
avoided O
each B-TIME
week I-TIME
being O
the O
same O
with O
a O
pupil O
knowing O
exactly O
what O
the O
subject O
would O
be O
on O
Friday B-TIME
afternoon I-TIME
at O
3 B-TIME
p.m. I-TIME
. O

It O
was O
a O
little O
complicated O
to O
work O
, O
of O
course O
, O
and O
there O
had O
to O
be O
a O
big O
notice O
in O
the O
entrance O
saying O
which O
day O
of O
the O
timetable O
it O
was O
- O
but O
it O
added O
immensely O
to O
the O
interest O
and O
kept O
everybody O
on O
their O
toes O
. O

To O
have O
order O
does O
not O
mean O
getting O
into O
a O
dull O
routine O
. O

I O
have O
great O
sympathy O
with O
the O
young O
wife O
who O
does O
not O
always O
want O
to O

not O

if O
she O
wants O
to O

through O
the O

she O
will O
be O
well O

sit O
down O
quietly O

make O
a O
list O
of O
everything O
she O
has O
got O
to O
do O

note O
the O
order O
in O
which O
they O
can O
most O
conveniently O
be O
done O
( O
or O
must O
be O
done O
because O
of O
other O

why O

a O
careful O
examination O
of O
that O
passage O
makes O
it O
clear O
that O
these O
are O
not O

From O
the O

that O

once O

, O
we O
have O
a O
good O

how O
a O

has O
been O
fashioned O
from O
material O
already O

from O

There O
is O
no O

The O
question O
and O
answer O
with O
regard O
to O
the O
need O
for O
the O
text O
of O
the O
angel O
are O
quoted O
here O
in O
the O
same O
words O
in O
which O
they O
are O
quoted O
in O
the O
discussion O
on O
the O
Mishnah O

This O
can O
either O
mean O
that O
both O
sugyas O
are O
quoting O
a O
well-known O
question O
and O
answer O
or O
that O
our O
sugya O
is O
quoting O
from O
the O
longer O
sugya O
which O
deals O
with O
all O
four B-CARDINAL
texts O
quoted O
in O
the O
Mishnah O

Or O
it O
is O
possible O
that O
our O
sugya O
contains O
the O
original O
question O

answer O
and O
this O
is O
quoted O
in O
the O
other O
sugya O

The O

quoted O
and O
the O
interpretation O
of O
the O
latter O
part O
of O
the O
verse O
by O
Rami B-PERSON
bar I-PERSON
Rabh I-PERSON
is O
added O
, O
not O
because O
this O
is O
at O
all O
relevant O
to O
the O
discussion O
but O
because O
it O
was O
a O
familiar O
interpretation O
which O
had O
become O
so O
well O
known O
that O
it O
was O
invariably O
quoted O
whenever O
the O
verse O
itself O
was O
quoted O
, O
almost O
as O
if O
it O
were O
a O
part O
of O
the O
verse O
. O

The O
Gemara O
continues O
with O
a O
saying O
of O
the O
Palestinian B-NORP
teacher O
, O
R. B-PERSON
Eleazar I-PERSON
( O
3rd B-TIME
Cent. I-TIME
) O
: O
' O
The O
Holy O
Spirit O
manifested O
itself O
in O
three B-CARDINAL
places O
: O
the O
court O
of O
Shem B-PERSON
, O
the O
court O
of O
Samuel B-PERSON
of I-PERSON
Ramah I-PERSON
, O
and O
the O
court O
of O
Solomon B-PERSON
. O

' O
The O
place O
of O
this O
saying O
here O
is O
obvious O
, O
it O
follows O
naturally O
on O
the O
saying O
of O
R. B-PERSON
Joshua I-PERSON
b. I-PERSON
Levi I-PERSON
which O
deals O
with O
a O
similar O
theme O
. O

We O
know O
from O
the O
diaries O
of O
Samuel B-PERSON
Pepys I-PERSON
that O
he O
was O
a O
great O
man O
for O
lace O
- O
paying O
as B-CARDINAL
much I-CARDINAL
as I-CARDINAL
3 I-CARDINAL
for O
a O
lace O
collar O
. O

But O
this O
didn't O
mean O
he O
was O
prepared O
to O
do O
as O
much O
for O
his O
lady O
, O
for O
he O
records O
testily O
: O
' O
My O
wife O
and O
I O
fell O
out O
about O
my O
not O
being O
willing O
to O
have O
her O
gown O
laced O
. O

' O
We O
read O
, O
with O
sympathy O
, O
an O
advertisement O
in O
the O
reign O
of O
Charles B-PERSON
2 I-PERSON
stating O
: O
' O
Lost O
: O
a O
lawn O
1hand- O
kercher O
with O
a O
broad O
hem O
laced O
round O
with O
fine O

lace O
about O
four B-CARDINAL
fingers O
broad O
' O
and O
among O
the O
effects O
left O
by O
Nell B-PERSON
Gwyn I-PERSON
is O
an O
unpaid O
bill O
for O
' O
scarlet O
satin O
shoes O
with O
silver O
lace O
' O
. O

The O
records O
of O
these O
tender O
trifles O
are O
very O
touching O
but O
then O
lace O
does O
place O
upon O
everything O
a O
delicate O
sentiment O
. O

One O
can O
remember O
with O
horror O
the O
pictures O
of O
the O
overcrowded O
and O
over-embellished O
drawing-rooms O
complete O
with O
heavy O
crochet O
antimacassars O
, O
mantel- O
piece O
covers O
with O
a O
fringing O
of O
clumsy O
bobbles O
and O
numerous O
other O
crocheted O
pieces O
. O

It O
was O
some B-TIME
years I-TIME
after O
the O
Victorian B-TIME
period O
that O
designers O
realised O
the O
potentialities O
of O
the O
craft O
, O
and O
crochet O
was O
revived O
with O
designs O
suitable O
for O
contemporary O
trends O
. O

Crochet O
today B-TIME
has O
a O
variety O
of O
uses O
, O
and O
has O
even O
stepped O
into O
the O
field O
of O
high O
fashion O
. O

First B-CARDINAL
launder O
crochet O
and O
then O
pin O
to O
the O
required O
shape O
, O
ensuring O
that O
all O
lines O
of O
the O
crochet O
are O
accurate O
. O

Place O
crochet O
in O
correct O
position O
on O
linen O
and O
secure O
with O
pins O
. O

Run O
a O
line O
of O
basting O
stitches O
on O
the O
linen O
following O
the O
outline O
of O
the O
crochet O
edges O

Two B-CARDINAL
methods O
can O
be O
used O
to O
join O

with O
a O
certain O
size O
of O
thread O
. O

To O
ensure O
the O
correct O
results O
, O
it O
is O
important O
that O
you O
use O
the O
size O
of O
hook O

A O
great O
deal O
of O
modern O
furniture O
has O
tapered O
legs O
, O
and O
in O
reproduction O
period O
pieces O
they O
are O
frequently O
used O
. O

The O
simpler O
varieties O
are O
extremely O
easy O
to O
work O
, O
the O
four B-CARDINAL
sides O
being O
simply O
planed O
to O
give O
the O
required O
taper O
. O

In O
the O
more O
elaborate O
varieties O
, O
however O
, O
a O
toe O
is O
worked O
in O
the O
solid O
, O
and O
this O
certainly O
complicates O
the O
operation O
. O

For O
short O
ones O
a O
smoothing O
plane O
can O
be O
used O
. O

The O
gauge O
can O
now O
be O
used O
to O
nick O
in O
the O
tapers O
on O
the O
newly O
planed O
surfaces O
, O
and O
these O
treated O
as O
before O
. O

It O
is O
unnecessary O
to O
mark O
the O
taper O
with O
the O
straight-edge O
as O
one O
relies O
upon O
the O
truth O
of O
the O
plane O
sole O
to O
make O
the O
tapered O
surfaces O
straight O
. O

A O
glance O
at O
the O
gauge O
marks O
at O
the O
bottom O
end O
reveals O
when O
the O
required O
amount O
has O
been O
removed O
, O
and O
if O
care O
is O
taken O
to O
stop O
the O
plane O
short O
of O
the O
squared O
pencil O
line O
at O
the O
top O
, O
the O
work O
will O
be O
accurate O
. O

The O
straight-edge O
can O
be O
used O
to O
test O
the O
straightness O
of O
the O
sides O
. O

Note O
that O
squared O
lines O
marking O
the O
top O
member O
of O
the O
toe O
are O
needed O
as O
well O
as O
the O
upper O
ex- O
tent O
of O
the O
taper O
, O
and O
in O
this O
case O
it O
is O
necessary O
to O
mark O
in O
the O
line O
of O
the O
taper O
with O
pencil O
and O
straight-edge O
as O
at O

But O
why O
woodwork O
in O
particular O
? O

Well O
, O
there O
are O
many O
reasons O
. O

Wood O
is O
in O
good O
and O
common O
supply O
; O
it O
lends O
itself O
to O
making O
innumerable O
useful O
household O
items O
- O
furniture O
, O
fitments O
, O
garden O
items O
, O
toys O
, O
etc. O
; O
it O
enables O
results O
to O
be O
obtained O
fairly O
quickly O
; O
it O
is O
less O
expensive O
than O
most O
other O
materials O
; O
it O
is O
a O
pleasant O
material O
to O
work O
with O
; O
and O
, O
although O
it O
does O
create O
a O
certain O
amount O
of O
mess O
, O
it O
is O
all O
clean O
and O
easily O
cleared O
away O
. O

As O
a O
still O
further O
development O
, O
we O
follow O
with O
a O
good O
basic O
kit O
, O
which O
includes O
the O
fuller O
kit O
( O
which O
in O
its O
turn O
, O
of O
course O
, O
includes O
the O
bare O
minimum O
kit O
) O
. O

With O
this O
the O
vast O
majority O
of O
jobs O
can O
be O
done O
, O
though O
for O
advanced O
cabinet O
work O
the O
necessity O
for O
certain O
special O
tools O
will O
become O
obvious O
. O

Many O
men O
with O
only O
limited O
accommodation O
have O
to O
do O
their O
woodwork O
on O
the O
kitchen O
table O
. O

Providing O
this O
is O
sound O
, O
some O
perfectly O
good O
work O
can O
be O
done O
on O
it O
, O
but O
the O
usual O
problems O
are O
those O
of O
the O
vice O
, O
the O
bench O
stop O
, O
and O
storage O
place O
for O
tools O
. O

The O
combined O
bench O
top O
and O
tool O
cupboard O
shown O
here O
has O
been O
specially O
designed O
and O
made O
for O
WOODWORKER B-ORGANIZATION
readers O
who O
have O
this O
difficulty O
. O

Start O
by O
making O
the O
two B-CARDINAL
side O
frames O
from O
1 B-CARDINAL
in. O
by O
1 B-CARDINAL
1/4 I-CARDINAL
in. O
planed O
timber O
as O
shown O
in O
Fig. O
1 B-CARDINAL
. O

Although O
the O
timber O
will O
have O
already O
been O
machine O
planed O
, O
remember O
to O
go O
over O
each O
piece O
with O
a O
smoothing O
plane O
, O
otherwise O
the O
marks O
left O
by O
the O
cutters O
will O
show O
up O
after O
painting O
. O

The O
dimensions O
given O
enable O
the O
feeding O
tray O
to O
slide O
over O
a O
30 B-CARDINAL
in. O
table O
, O
but O
the O
height O
can O
be O
altered O
if O
required O
. O

All O
the O
joints O
are O
simple O
halving O
joints O
glued O
and O
pinned O
, O
which O
should O
nevertheless O
be O
cut O
with O
care O
to O
ensure O
a O
neat O
appearance O
. O

The O
side O
frames O
are O
joined O
by O
four B-CARDINAL
cross O
pieces O
each O
1 B-CARDINAL
1/4 I-CARDINAL
in. O
by O
1/2 B-CARDINAL

which O
fit O
into O
the O
recesses O
( O

, O
cut O
to O
fit O
them O
. O

The O
amount O
of O
the O
backward O
tilt O
and O
also O
the O
height O
is O
left O
to O
personal O
choice O
and O
the O
width O
is O
best O
taken O
directly O
from O
the O
work O
to O
ensure O
a O
good O
fit O
. O

Fix O
the O
piece O
A O
to O
the O
sides O
first B-CARDINAL
with O
glue O
and O
panel O
pins O
and O
then O
fit O
the O
frame O
together O
with O
the O
piece O
B O
temporarily O
in O
place O
on O
the O
chair O
frame O
. O

Decide O
on O
the O
required O
angle O
of O
slope O
, O
keeping O
B O
flat O
on O
the O
chair O
seat O
, O
and O
mark O
off O
the O
exact O
position O
of O
B O
on O
the O
side O
pieces O
. O

These O
can O
then O
be O
cut O
at O
the O
correct O
angle O
and O
B O
is O
glued O
and O
nailed O
in O
place O
. O

A O
piece O
of O
hardboard O
is O
then O
cut O
and O
pinned O
to O
the O
frame O
and O
its O
edges O
planed O
off O
flush O
. O

Finally O
attach O
the O
back O
firmly O
to O
the O
sides O
with O
screws O
driven O
from O
the O
inside O
. O

The O
footrest O

When O
determining O
the O
position O
of O
the O
footrest O
, O
do O
not O
place O
too O
near O
the O
seat O
to O
allow O
for O
the O
growth O
of O
baby's O
legs O
. O

To O
complete O
the O
job O
, O
screw O
two B-CARDINAL
fittings O
to O
the O
inside O
of O
the O
chair O
arms O
about B-CARDINAL
2 I-CARDINAL
1/2 I-CARDINAL

from O
the O
back O
to O
hold O
the O
baby's O
safety O
harness O
. O

These O
can O
be O
made O
by O
shaping O
and O
soldering O
two B-CARDINAL
pieces O
of O
stout O
wire O
as O
shown O
in O
Fig. O
6 B-CARDINAL
. O

Make O
sure O
that O
these O
are O
well O
secured O
as O
they O
will O
have O
to O
withstand O
considerable O
pulling O
as O
the O
child O
becomes O
older O
. O

Here O
are O
the O
plans O
of O
a O
very O
seaworthy O
little O
rowing O
dinghy O
many O
of O
which O
I O
have O
built O
and O
sold O
. O

It O
is O
especially O
designed O
for O
simplicity O
in O
construction O
, O
cheapness O
and O
lightness O
of O
weight O
, O
and O
measures O
approximately B-CARDINAL
8 I-CARDINAL
ft. O
by O
4 B-CARDINAL
ft. O
She O
weighs O
only O
60 B-CARDINAL
lb. O
but O
can O
carry O
three B-CARDINAL
people O
and O
an O
outboard O
motor O
with O
a O
comfortable O
margin O
of O
freeboard O
. O

For O
instance O
, O
in O
Canada B-LOCATION
we O
use O
galvanised O
nails O
in O
place O
of O
screws O
. O

We O
just O
bend O
them O
over O
and O
clamp O
firmly O
by O
using O
a O
hammer O
on O
each O
side O
. O

Over O
here O
I O
've O
always O
used O
brass O
screws O
, O
which O
are O
more O
expensive O
. O

The O
first B-CARDINAL
job O
is O
to O
make O
your O
moulds O
. O

In O
Fig. O
1 B-CARDINAL
it O
quotes O
3/4 B-CARDINAL
in. O
five-ply B-CARDINAL
, O
but O
to O
save O
money O
any O
scrap O
may O
be O
used O
, O
and O
if O
this O
is O
nailed O
and O
glued O
together O
strongly O
, O
it O
may O
be O
marked O
and O
cut O
to O
shape O
later O
. O

If O
you O
do O
not O
have O
a O
wooden O
floor O
on O
which O
to O
anchor O
the O
moulds O
, O
make O
a O
frame O
of O
rough O
lumber O
as O
shown O
in O
Fig. O
2 B-CARDINAL
. O

The O
main O
idea O
is O
to O
have O
the O
moulds O
standing O
as O
rigid O
as O
possible O
, O
for O
it O
is O
on O
these O
you O
will O
be O
building O
and O
shaping O
your O
little O
craft O
, O
upside-down O
. O

For O
cheapness O
I O
recommend O
using O
Douglas O
Fir O
Plywood O
from O
British B-LOCATION
Columbia I-LOCATION
. O

The O
chine O
is O
the O
long O
stringer O
on O
each O
side O
which O
is O
joined O
to O
both O
transoms O
and O
lies O
in O
the O
grooves O
cut O
in O
the O
moulds O
. O

Each O
chine O
is O
made O
of O
oak O
, O
ash O
, O
spruce O
or O
any O
long O
grained O
flexible O
wood O
. O

I O
prefer O
spruce O
when O
available O
. O

As O
will O
be O
seen O
in O
the O
plan O
, O
the O
transoms O
have O
a O
frame O
1 B-CARDINAL
in. O
by O
1 B-CARDINAL
in. O
on O
each O
side O
. O

Having O
trimmed O
up O
the O
chines O
, O
we O
are O
now O
ready O
to O
plank O
the O
sides O
. O

Start O
again O
at O
the O
bows O
, O
clamping O
into O
position O
with O
a O
' O
D O
' O
clamp O
. O

Bend O
round O
the O
frame O
to O
the O
stern O
and O
clamp O
there O
. O

If O
you O
have O
a O
third B-CARDINAL
clamp O
use O
it O
in O
the O
centre O
as O
well O
. O

After O
generously O
covering O
with O
glue O
, O
screw O
the O
sides O
to O
the O
transom O
framing O
and O
the O
chine O
. O

Use O
5/8 B-CARDINAL
by O
No. O
4 B-CARDINAL
gauge O
screws O
( O
brass O
) O
or O
nail O
with O
inch O
and O
a O
quarter O
galvanized O
nails O
, O
if O
you O
are O
doing O
it O
that O
way O
. O

Use O
flat O
head O
screws O
about B-CARDINAL
4 I-CARDINAL
in. O
apart O
and O
do O
not O
counter-sink O
in O
the O
1/4 B-CARDINAL
in. O
ply O
. O

Make O
a O
very O
small O
hole O
for O
the O
screw O
to O
allow O
for O
a O
good O
grip O
. O

Remember O
to O
glue O
before O
screwing O
. O

Clean O
up O
with O
the O
plane O
ready O
for O
the O
bottom O
, O
which O
is O
cut O
in O
one B-CARDINAL
piece O
. O

It O
should O
overlap O
just O
a O
trifle O
; O
this O
can O
be O
cleaned O
up O
later O
. O

As O
you O
are O
screwing O
and O
gluing O
this O
piece O
to O
the O
chines O
it O
is O
necessary O
to O
be O
careful O
not O
to O
miss O
the O
chine O
with O
the O
screws O
. O

I O
prefer O
spacing O
screws O
3 B-CARDINAL
in. O
apart O
for O
the O
bottom O
, O
both O
for O
screwing O
to O
the O
chines O
and O
the O
bottom O
shaped O
transom O
facing O
. O

This O
could O
hardly O
happen O
without O
the O
herring O
having O
some O
orientation O
with O
the O
sea O
bottom O
. O

It O
means O
that O
the O
crowding O
is O
caused O
during O
the O
daytime O
, O
and O
that O
the O
herring O
must O
continue O
to O
migrate O
over O
the O
ground O
as O
well O
as O
in O
midwater O
and O
during O
the O
swim O
( O
the O
swim O
at O
East B-LOCATION
Anglia I-LOCATION
is O
always O
from O
the O
north O
) O
. O

Thus O
we O
can O
see O
that O
herring O
movements O
, O
although O
primarily O
instinctive O
perhaps O
, O
and O
certainly O
helped O
and O
hindered O
by O
water O
flow O
, O
are O
also O
closely O
related O
to O
the O
sea-bed O
geography O
. O

Geography O
, O
too O
, O
names O
the O
great O
fisheries O
that O
depend O
on O
them O
: O
the O
Fladen B-LOCATION
Ground I-LOCATION
( O
where O
again O
most O
big O
shots O
are O
taken O
on O
the O
edges O
) O
, O
the O
Gut B-LOCATION
, O
a O
deep-water O
channel O
to O
the O
Dogger B-LOCATION
where O
the O
herring O
spawn O
along O
the O
northern O
The O
effect O
of O
bottom O
congestion O
due O
to O
the O
light O
pressure O
is O
inevitably O
mixed O
with O
that O
of O
the O
suitability O
of O
ground O
for O
spawning O
. O

Both O
result O
in O
crowding O
, O
so O
there O
is O
no O
need O
to O
try O
to O
separate O
them O
- O
thank O
Heaven O
! O

A O
good O
picture O
of O
this O
is O
seen O
on O
the O
150 B-CARDINAL
miles O
of O
spawning O
grounds O
from O
the O
Viking B-LOCATION
in O
the O
north O
down O
to O
the O
Klondykes B-LOCATION
and O
the O
Reef B-LOCATION
along O
the O
western O
edge O
of O
the O
Norwegian B-LOCATION
Deep I-LOCATION
. O

In O
this O
200-fathom B-CARDINAL
trench O
the O
herring O
do O
not O
touch O
the O
bottom O
. O

Their O
descent O
stops O
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
light O
pressure O
. O

But O
they O
migrate O
easterly O
to O
the O
Norwegian B-NORP
side O
, O
or O
westerly O
, O
until O
in O
the O
shallower O
water O
the O
mile O
wide O
layers O
disappear O
from O
the O
echo-sounders O
. O

Bottom O
crowding O
comes O
when O
they O
cannot O
reach O
their O
optimum O
depth O
; O
and O
this O
coincides O
with O
the O
suitable O
gravelly O
soil O
of O
these O
many O
roughs O
where O
the O
spring- O
spawning O
herring O
are O
always O
found O
. O

The O
joint O
evidence O
of O
echo-sounders O
and O
fishing O
gear O
leads O
to O
an O
overall O
though O
somewhat O
dim O
picture O
. O

The O
details O
are O
harder O
still O
to O
see O
. O

Drift O
Effects O
. O

At O
East B-LOCATION
Anglia I-LOCATION
, O
for O
instance O
, O
shoals O
that O
gather O
at O
the O
Knoll B-LOCATION
or O
other O
banks O
are O
most O
of O
them O
going O
to O
travel O
a B-CARDINAL
hundred I-CARDINAL
miles O
farther O
south O
before O
they O
spawn O
. O

Some O
will O
spawn O
at O
the O
So O
the O
arrival O
of O
any O
particular O
shoal O
fish O
at O
a O
certain O
spawning O
ground O
may O
be O
accidental O
. O

Yet O
there O
will O
always O
be O
some O
that O
find O
it O
if O
enough O
are O
travelling O
, O
just O
as O
the O
robin O
who O
gets O
back O
exactly O
may O
be O
only B-CARDINAL
one I-CARDINAL
among O
thousands B-CARDINAL
who O
do O
not O
. O

But O
this O
southerly O
migration O
is O
not O
accidental O
. O

Being O
contranatant O
or O
against O
the O
drift O
, O
it O
probably O
has O
a O
survival O
value O
in O
ensuring O
that O
the O
fry O
after O
hatching O
are O
drifted O
back O
into O
the O
normal O
home O
Drift O
in O
another O
form O
probably O
explains O
how O
these O
migrating O
herring O
are O
biased O
to O
east O
or O
west O
by O
the O
different O
winds O
. O

Strong O
westerlies O
are O
well O
known O
to O
bring O
good O
longshore O
fishings O
. O

The O
surface O
water O
that O
is O
blown O
offshore O
must O
be O
replaced O
by O
an O
underflow O
bringing O
with O
it O
the O
herring O
to O
the O
Norfolk B-LOCATION
and O
Suffolk B-LOCATION
beaches O
. O

Easterly O
winds O
, O
on O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
mean O
no O
herring O
along O
the O
shore O
, O
as O
recent B-TIME
years I-TIME
have O
shown O
. O

A O
succession O
of O
winds O
is O
needed O
for O
this O
effect O
of O
course O
- O
one B-CARDINAL
breeze O
will O
not O
do O
it O
, O
though O
a O
very O
hard O
westerly O
will O
often O
start O
off O
the O
" O
local O
" O
herring O
; O
but O
quite O
apart O
from O
this O
wind O
effect O
there O
is O
an O
easterly O
drift O
special O
to O
this O
rump O
of O
coastline O
, O
caused O
by O
the O
meeting O
of O
water O
from O
north O
and O
south O
. O

Herring O
fishermen O
call O
this O
" O
the O
outset O
" O
. O

It O
is O
strongest O
at O
spring O
tides O
, O
when O
without O
wind O
you O
will O
" O
set O
" O
out O
- O
or O
drift O
to O
the O
east- O
ward O
, O
the O
length O
of O
half B-CARDINAL
a O
fleet O
of O
nets O
- O
almost O
a O
mile O
on O
every O
tide O
at O
the O
Smith's B-LOCATION
Knoll I-LOCATION
. O

Without O
an O
explanation O
of O
how O
it O
works O
, O
it O
may O
well O
be O
that O
this O
outset O
, O
akin O
to O
the O
mouth O
of O
a O
great O
salmon O
river O
, O
has O
been O
the O
biggest O
factor O
through O
the O
ages O
in O
the O
constancy O
of O
this O
great O
herring O
fishery O
. O

The O
East B-NORP
Anglian I-NORP
behaviour O
( O
see O
p. O
82 B-CARDINAL
) O
has O
always O
differed O
from O
that O
of O
the O
summer B-TIME
fisheries O
. O

There O
is O
the O
" O
swim O
" O
at O
slack O
waters O
, O
even O
in O
daylight O
sometimes O
; O
and O
the O
high O
swimming O
, O
when O
fish O
are O
caught O
only O
in O
the O
top O
few O
yards O
of O
netting O
. O

These O
and O
other O
fascinating O
behaviour O
mysteries O
are O
peculiar O
to O
this O
fishery O
, O
which O
unfortunately O
seems O
to O
be O
dying O
out O
; O
but O
a O
full O
discussion O
of O
them O
is O
beyond O
the O
present O
scope O
. O

The O
Bow-wave O
Theory O
. O

This O
assumes O
that O
all O
fishing O
gear O
, O
when O
moving O
, O
sends O
before O
it O
a O
kind O
of O
scaring O
effect O
, O
probably O
through O
waves O
or O
vibrations O
in O
the O
water O
or O
along O
the O
ground O
. O

Underwater O
films O
suggest O
that O
the O
footrope O
of O
a O
trawl O
does O
this O
. O

Films O
have O
also O
shown O
plaice O
moving O
before O
a O
seine O
net O
in O
just O
the O
same O
way O
after O
being O
gathered O
inwards O
by O
the O
ropes O
. O

( O
Just O
how O
the O
seine O
ropes O
do O
this O
is O
not O
yet O
proved O
; O
it O
may O
be O
by O
actual O
contact O
, O
or O
by O
sight O
reaction O
to O
the O
disturbed O
sand O
; O
or O
even O
in O
the O
case O
of O
flat O
fish O
, O
by O
vibrations O
through O
or O
along O
the O
bottom O
. O

) O
But O
given O
such O
a O
bow O
wave O
of O
disturbance O
, O
it O
is O
obvious O
that O
without O
something O
to O
overcome O
its O
effect O
, O
very O
few O
fish O
would O
be O
caught O
. O

Let O
us O
consider O
first B-CARDINAL
what O
would O
appear O
to O
be O
the O
simplest O
case O
- O
that O
of O
flat O
fish O
on O
the O
bottom O
. O

The O
evidence O
suggest O
that O
the O
fish O
are O
aware O
of O
the O
moving O
footrope O
before O
it O
reaches O
them O
. O

They O
move O
away O
before O
it O
, O
swimming O
at O
the O
same O
speed O
for O
an O
unknown O
period O
of O
time O
, O
until O
they O
become O
( O
1 B-CARDINAL
) O
tired O
, O
or O
( O
2 B-CARDINAL
) O
more O
used O
to O
the O
disturbance O
. O

Then O
they O
stop O
swimming O
and O
are O
caught O
. O

In O
the O
seine-net O
film O
this O
usually O
seemed O
to O
happen O
just O
after O
the O
fish O
had O
risen O
above O
the O
footrope O
, O
and O
presumably O
out O
of O
its O
field O
of O
disturbance O
, O
or O
bow O
wave O
. O

This O
suggests O
that O
the O
wave O
might O
be O
transmitted O
by O
the O
sea-bed O
, O
though O
the O
footrope O
in O
this O
case O
was O
actually O
just O
off O
the O
bottom O
and O
was O
indeed O
passing O
over O
some O
fish O
. O

Actually O
the O
seine O
net O
has O
little O
or O
no O
cover O
. O

And O
in O
this O
film O
the O
rise O
of O
the O
fish O
was O
small O
, O
a O
matter O
of O
a O
foot O
or O
two B-CARDINAL
. O

With O
round O
fish O
like O
haddock O
, O
which O
would O
hardly O
find O
safety O
on O
the O
bottom O
, O
this O
cover O
would O
seem O
to O
be O
even O
more O
essential O
; O
but O
more O
films O
are O
needed O
to O
prove O
this O
. O

Cover O
in O
the O
fast-moving O
trawl O
is O
considered O
essential O
to O
catch O
round O
fish O
whose O
reaction O
to O
disturbance O
would O
be O
upwards O
. O

The O
main O
disadvantage O
of O
the O
clay O
pot O
is O
its O
brittle O
nature O
; O
even O
with O
reasonably O
careful O
handling O
, O
the O
annual O
losses O
are O
often O
around B-CARDINAL
10 I-CARDINAL
per O
cent. O
, O
and O
where O
the O
handling O
and O
storage O
facilities O
are O
not O
too O
good O
, O
these O
losses O
will O
be O
even O
greater O
. O

This O
does O
not O
necessarily O
apply O
to O
the O
larger O
sizes O
, O
as O
they O
are O
not O
quite O
so O
fragile O
as O
the O
smaller O
ones O
and O
are O
not O
normally O
thrown O
about O
in O
quite O
the O
same O
way O
. O

The O
storage O
problem O
puts O
clay O
pots O
at O
a O
definite O
disadvantage O
. O

They O
are O
fairly O
heavy O
and O
difficult O
things O
to O
accommodate O
and O
they O
must O
have O
some O
protection O
from O
severe O
weather O
, O
which O
can O
be O
quite O
a O
headache O
in O
a O
small O
garden O
. O

While O
admitting O
that O
broken O
pots O
have O
on O
occasions O
provided O
artists O
with O
delightful O
studies O
, O
there O
is O
no O
doubt O
that O
a O
pile O
of O
badly O
stacked O
, O
half-broken B-CARDINAL
pots O
is O
an O
unlovely O
sight O
from O
any O
point O
of O
view O
. O

Every O
garden O
boy O
will O
agree O
that O
having O
to O
wash O
clay O
pots O
is O
a O
definite O
factor O
in O
favour O
of O
their O
abolition O
; O
in O
fact O
one B-CARDINAL
young O
man O
was O
so O
wholehearted O
about O
this O
a B-TIME
few I-TIME
years I-TIME
ago I-TIME
that O
he O
made O
the O
headlines O
for O
having O
smashed O
a O
large O
number O
 O
to O
relieve O
his O
feelings O
. O

On O
the O
small-to-medium O
establishment O
, O
it O
is O
a O
disagreeable O
chore O
which O
nobody O
tackles O
with O
any O
enthusiasm O
, O
whereas O
on O
larger O
establishments O
the O
pots O
can O
be O
sterilized O
or O
washed O
by O
machine O
. O

It O
is O
not O
easy O
to O
make O
an O
economic O
comparison O
between O
clay O
pots O
and O
the O
various O
substitutes O
; O
the O
former O
may O
last O
indefinitely O
with O
luck O
, O
while O
the O
latter O
are O
often O
expendable O
used O
only O
once O
. O

Clay O
pots O
are O
efficient O
and O
congenial O
containers O
in O
which O
to O
grow O
plants O
. O

In O
their O
proper O
setting O
they O
are O
not O
unattractive O
and O
, O
in O
spite O
of O
their O
shortcomings O
, O
most O
gardeners O
have O
a O
nostalgic O
affection O
for O
them O
. O

Present-day O
pots O
are O
better O
finished O
, O
do O
not O
get O
dirty O
so O
readily O
and O
are O
easier O
to O
wash O
. O

The O
deep O
rims O
make O
for O
neater O
and O
safer O
stacking O
, O
though O
they O
are O
still O
expensive O
and O
still O
get O
broken O
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
there O
is O
really O
no O
replacement O
for O
the O
larger O
sizes O
, O
so O
they O
have O
the O
decided O
advantage O
of O
being O
the O
only O
suitable O
container O
available O
in O
quantity O
for O
fairly O
large O
plants O
. O

The O
job O
of O
the O
teacher O
is O
to O
set O
the O
learner's O
vocabulary O
to O
work O
on O
the O
existing O
store O
so O
as O
to O
make O
it O
grow O
. O

He O
does O
not O
simply O
pack O
new O
things O
into O
the O
store O
. O

The O
solitary O
learner O
has O
to O
find O
out O
how O
to O
do O
this O
for O
himself O
, O
with O
the O
help O
of O
books O
. O

He O
uses O
his O
vocabulary O
to O
ask O
questions O
and O
uses O
the O
books O
to O
find O
the O
answers O
. O

Thus O
learning O
how O
to O
learn O
means O
becoming O
your O
own O
philosopher O
, O
your O
own O
psychologist O
and O
your O
own O
teacher O
. O

You O
will O
then O
be O
a O
well-established O
learner O
and O
the O
world O
will O
be O
at O
your O
feet O
. O

Although O
the O
word O
" O
mind O
" O
has O
given O
rise O
to O
endless O
controversy O
among O
philosophers O
and O
psycho- O
logists O
, O
many O
of O
whom O
would O
like O
to O
abolish O
it O
from O
the O
dictionary O
, O
most O
of O
us O
obstinately O
go O
on O
using O
it O
. O

And O
then O
you O
get O
a O
knock O
on O
the O
head O
and O
all O
evidence O
of O
" O
mind O
" O
vanishes O
, O
at O
any O
rate O
for O
some O
time O
. O

It O
seems O
very O
difficult O
to O
detach O
the O
mind O
from O
the O
brain O
, O
and O
all O
the O
biological O
, O
surgical O
and O
pharmacological O
evidence O
points O
to O
a O
very O
close O
connection O
. O

There O
is O
a O
lot O
to O
be O
said O
for O
keeping O
the O
word O
" O
soul O
" O
to O
stand O
for O
what O
many O
believe O
to O
be O
the O
imperishable O
essence O
of O
a O
man O
which O
is O
supposed O
to O
persist O
apart O
from O
the O
body O
, O
and O
to O
reserve O
the O
more O
prosaic O
word O
" O
mind O
" O
for O
the O
basis O
of O
all O
those O
experiences O
and O
phenomena O
which O
are O
clearly O
associated O
with O
the O
brain O
. O

Can O
we O
now O
put O
forward O
any O
reasonably O
clear O
picture O
of O
this O
" O
basis O
" O
of O
mental O
phenomena O
? O

The O
physicists O
have O
succeeded O
remarkably O
well O
, O
with O
the O
atomic O
theory O
, O
in O
giving O
a O
clear O
and O
detailed O
picture O
of O
the O
basis O
of O
such O
material O
phenomena O
as O
chemical O
action O
, O
magnetism O
, O
the O
behaviour O
of O
gases O
and O
so O
on O
. O

Where O
has O
psychology O
got O
to O
in O
its O
theories O
of O
" O
mind O
" O
? O

Are O
there O
any O
ultimate O
units O
of O
mind O
akin O
to O
the O
atoms O
of O
matter O
? O

At O
one O
time O
it O
was O
thought O
that O
mind O
could O
indeed O
be O
analysed O
into O
discrete O
bits O
. O

These O
bits O
were O
identified O
as O
elementary O
sensations O
. O

These O
were O
thought O
to O
combine O
together O
to O
form O
compound O
experiences O
by O
analogy O
with O
the O
way O
atoms O
of O
matter O
combine O
to O
form O
molecular O
compounds O
. O

But O
this O
view O
led O
to O
too O
many O
difficulties O
and O
was O
finally O
abandoned O
. O

Nevertheless O
the O
search O
for O
basic O
units O
of O
mind O
has O
gone O
on O
and O
will O
doubtless O
continue O
, O
for O
it O
is O
the O
aim O
of O
science O
to O
discover O
ultimate O
units O
. O

It O
is O
the O
tendency O
to O
get O
things O
the O
wrong O
way O
round O
. O

As O
a O
psychologist O
I O
am O
constantly O
encountering O
this O
tendency O
in O
friends O
and O
acquaintances O
. O

They O
think O
there O
is O
something O
inevitably O
" O
queer O
" O
about O
psychology O
and O
this O
feeling O
of O
queerness O
usually O
boils O
down O
to O
a O
quite O
mistaken O
belief O
that O
the O
psychologist O
first B-CARDINAL
looks O
into O
... O
And O
so O
they O
prefer O
objective O
methods O
. O

Since O
they O
cannot O
directly O
look O
into O
the O
mental O
processes O
of O
another O
person O
they O
observe O
his O
visible O
behaviour O
and O
then O
try O
to O
give O
theoretical O
interpretations O
of O
what O
lies O
behind O
this O
behaviour O
. O

This O
is O
no O
more O
queer O
than O
the O
method O
of O
the O
doctor O
who O
observes O
signs O
, O
and O
records O
symptoms O
, O
and O
diagnoses O
the O
inner O
states O
responsible O
for O
them O
. O

He O
may O
never O
have O
had O
the O
disease O
himself O
but O
he O
can O
nevertheless O
identify O
it O
. O

Similarly O
the O
psychologist O
has O
to O
be O
prepared O
to O
observe O
and O
make O
inferences O
about O
all O
kinds O
of O
processes O
in O
other O
people O
, O
whether O
or O
not O
they O
correspond O
with O
anything O
in O
his O
own O
experience O
. O

We O
know O
very O
little O
about O
the O
patterns O
of O
brain-activity O
which O
provide O
our O
schemas O
, O
nor O
do O
we O
need O
to O
know O
as O
far O
as O
psychology O
is O
concerned O
- O
these O
patterns O
are O
the O
concern O
of O
the O
neuro-physiologists O
. O

The O

A O

A O

rather O
of O

individuals O
, O
from O
various O

in O
the O

In O
due O

the O

decided O
to O

further O

an O

of O
the O
problems O
of O

nearing O

also O
a O

In O

it O
was O
suggested O
by O
Mr. O
T. B-PERSON
M. I-PERSON
Banks I-PERSON
, O
Assistant O
Director O
of O
Education O
for O
Glasgow B-LOCATION
, O
that O

might O
be O
ready O
to O
let O
older O

attend O
day-release O
courses O
on O
preparation O
for O

, O
their O
wages O
paid O
for O
the O
time O
thus O
spent O
. O

An O
approach O
was O
made O
to O
about O
twenty B-CARDINAL
large O
firms O
and O
in O
Oc- B-TIME
tober I-TIME
, I-TIME
1959 I-TIME
, O
the O
first B-CARDINAL
experimental O
day-release O
course O
for O
men O
was O
organised O
. O

Eleven B-CARDINAL
students O
from O
seven B-CARDINAL
firms O
atten- O
ded O
a O
course O
on O
six B-TIME
full I-TIME
Fridays I-TIME
and O
it O
was O
made O
clear O
both O
to O
the O
men O
and O
their O
employers O
that O
the O
venture O
was O
an O
experiment O
from O
which O
the O
organisers O
hoped O
to O
learn O
as O
much O
as O
the O
participants O
. O

1 B-CARDINAL
. O

Are O
there O
differences O
in O
adjustment O
to O
ageing O
and O
retirement O
according O
to O
the O
occupational O
level O
of O
employees O
? O

2 B-CARDINAL
. O

If O
so O
, O
which O
occupational O
levels O
are O
the O
better O
or O
the O
poorer O
prepared O
for O
successful O
adjustment O
to O
retirement O
and O
in O
what O
aspects O
? O

3 B-CARDINAL
. O

Does O
the O
evidence O
obtained O
support O
a O
rationale O
for O
adapting O
a O
pre-retirement O
planning O
and O
preparation O
programme O
to O
the O
needs O
of O
older O
employees O
of O
different O
occupational O
levels O
? O

Each O
time O
you O
rehearse O
you O
will O
probably O
put O
things O
in O
a O
different O
way O
. O

All O
the O
better O
! O

- O
it O
will O
sound O
much O
more O
spontaneous O
on O
the O
occasion O
itself O
. O

Remember O
your O
four B-CARDINAL
names O
- O
have O
the O
list O
with O
you O
if O
you O
like O
- O
and O
you O
simply O
can't O
be O
flummoxed O
! O

Of O
course O
, O
in O
any O
speech O
a O
good O
start O
and O
a O
good O
finish O
are O
half B-CARDINAL
the O
battle O
. O

So O
- O
see O
the O
next O
page O
! O

Yes O
, O
they O
are O
waiting O
for O
you O
. O

But O
there O
is O
no O
need O
to O
be O
frightened O
. O

The O
audience O
will O
eat O
out O
of O
your O
hand O
- O
if O
they O
like O
what O
you O
offer O
them O
. O

A O
good O
start O
will O
put O
them O
in O
a O
good O
humour O
. O

Ladies O
and O
gentlemen O
! O

I O
'm O
afraid O
I O
have O
not O
had O
much O
experience O
of O
public O
speaking O
. O

But O
that O
's O
a O
terrible O
way O
to O
begin O
! O

Why O
tell O
them O
you O
are O
a O
novice O
? O

It O
's O
their O
interest O
you O
want O
- O
not O
their O
sympathy O
. O

And O
you O
want O
to O
get O
it O
from O
the O
word O
GO O
! O

Try O
something O
like O
this O
: O
It O
is O
said O
that O
tele- O
vision O
keeps O
people O
at O
home O
. O

But O
you O
, O
at O
any O
rate O
, O
have O
proved O
that O
wrong O
. O

And O
they O
say O
, O
too O
, O
that O
television O
makes O
its O
appeal O
to O
those O
of O
lesser O
intelligence O
. O

May O
I O
suggest O
that O
you O
have O
proved O
that O
right O
! O

Congratulations O
! O

And O
away O
you O
go O

Take O
some O
thought O

too O
, O
for O
your O

Thank O
you O
for O
listening O
to O
me O
so O
patiently O

A O
political O
candidate O
often O
used O
that O
finish O
. O

No O
wonder O
he O
didn't O
get O
in O
! O

Instead O
he O
might O
have O
ended O
this O
way O
: O
Well O
, O
those O
are O
my O
views O
. O

When O
he O
learned O
what O
was O
causing O
the O
commotion O
he O
became O
greatly O
alarmed O
, O
and O
after O
the O
body O
had O
been O
taken O
to O
St B-LOCATION
Thomas's I-LOCATION
Hospital I-LOCATION
it O
was O
his O
grief-stricken O
duty O
formally O
to O
identify O
Elizabeth B-PERSON
Camp I-PERSON
, O
aged O
thirty-three B-TIME
, O
the O
girl O
who O
was O
to O
have O
been O
his O
bride O
. O

There O
was O
little O
doubt O
of O
how O
she O
had O
met O
her O
death O
, O
and O
even O
less O
that O
it O
had O
been O
murder O
. O

The O
body O
was O
examined O
, O
and O
it O
was O
definitely O
established O
that O
no O
sexual O
assault O
had O
taken O
place O
. O

It O
seemed O
probable O
that O
the O
motive O
had O
been O
robbery O
, O
and O
this O
was O
further O
confirmed O
when O
a O
check O
was O
made O
with O
the O
woman's O
relations O
in O
Hounslow B-LOCATION
. O

Miss O
Camp B-PERSON
had O
been O
the O
housekeeper O
at O
the O
Good B-LOCATION
Intent I-LOCATION
, O
a O
public-house O
in O
Walworth B-LOCATION
. O

Her O
day O
off O
was O
Thursday B-TIME
, O
and O
before O
coming O
up O
to O
London B-LOCATION
in O
the O
evening B-TIME
she O
had O
called O
on O
her O
two B-CARDINAL
sisters O
, O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
whom O
lived O
at O
Hammersmith B-LOCATION
and O
the O
other O
at O
Hounslow B-LOCATION
, O
where O
she O
kept O
a O
shop O
. O

Elizabeth B-PERSON
had O
left O
Hammersmith B-LOCATION
in O
the O
late B-TIME
afternoon I-TIME
, O
and O
arrived O
at O
Hounslow B-LOCATION
around B-TIME
5 I-TIME
P.M. I-TIME
, O
where O
she O
had O
tea O
with O
her O
other O
sister O
, O
and O
then O
went O
to O
catch O
the O
7.42 B-CARDINAL
. O

Her O
sister O
saw O
her O
to O
the O
station O
, O
helping O
her O
with O
some O
of O
her O
packages O
. O

This O
sister O
was O
able O
to O
establish O
that O
she O
had O
carried O
a O
green O
purse O
and O
had O
bought O
a O
railway O
ticket O
. O

The O
police O
began O
a O
systematic O
search O
of O
the O
line O
- O
no O
easy O
task O
, O
but O
one O
in O
which O
patience O
and O
method O
paid O
off O
. O

At O
a O
spot O
on O
the O
embankment O
between O
Putney B-LOCATION
and O
Wandsworth B-LOCATION
they O
found O
a O
bloodstained O
pestle O
such O
as O
chemists O
use O
, O
with O
some O
hairs O
sticking O
to O
it O
. O

The O
murder O
weapon O
, O
more O
than O
likely O
, O
and O
perhaps O
evidence O
enough O
to O
have O
brought O
a O
killer O
to O
book O
in O
modern O
times O
. O

But O
in O
1897 B-TIME
, O
alas O
! O

there O
was O
no O
fingerprint O
bureau O
, O
no O
experts O
to O
check O
and O
photograph O
any O
' O
dabs O
' O
it O
might O
have O
yielded O
. O

It O
was O
a O
tough O
case O
to O
tackle O
, O
and O
Superintendent O
Robinson B-PERSON
, O
of O
the O
L.S.W.R. B-ORGANIZATION
Police O
, O
and O
Chief O
Inspector O
Marshall B-PERSON
, O
of O
Scotland B-ORGANIZATION
Yard I-ORGANIZATION
, O
combined O
forces O
in O
the O
investigation O
. O

While O
accepting O
the O
likelihood O
that O
Miss O
Camp B-PERSON
had O
been O
attacked O
for O
the O
sake O
of O
robbery O
, O
they O
did O
not O
overlook O
the O
possibility O
that O
this O
might O
have O
disguised O
another O
motive O
, O
and O
a O
thorough O
check O
of O
her O
former O
men O
friends O
and O
acquaintances O
began O
. O

They O
also O
had O
to O
cope O
with O
the O
usual O
flood O
of O
rumours O
, O
so- O
me O
well O
meant O
, O
some O
mischievous O
, O
including O
one O
that O
a O
man O
had O
been O
seen O
fleeing O
from O
Vauxhall B-LOCATION
station O
on O
the O
Thursday B-TIME
evening I-TIME
, O
with O
blood O
actually O
dripping O
from O
his O
hands O
. O

The O
inquest O
was O
opened O
on O
February B-TIME
17 I-TIME
, O
but O
, O
beyond O
the O
jury O
hearing O
a O
formal O
identification O
of O
the O
victim O
and O
inspecting O
at O
Waterloo B-LOCATION
the O
carriage O
in O
which O
she O
had O
died O
, O
there O
was O
nothing O
on O
which O
to O
proceed O
, O
and O
the O
inquest O
was O
adjourned O
. O

Day O
by O
day O
the O
police O
followed O
up O
likely O
and O
even O
unlikely O
trails O
. O

It O
was O
learned O
that O
Elizabeth B-PERSON
Camp I-PERSON
had O
been O
lending O
money O
to O
her O
relatives O
, O
and O
her O
brother-in-law O
was O
asked O
for O
a O
detailed O
account O
of O
his O
movements O
on O
the B-TIME
11th I-TIME
. O

The O
dead O
woman O
had O
been O
engaged O
once O
before O
- O
to O
a O
barman O
named O
Brown B-PERSON
. O

This O
man O
agreed O
that O
his O
engagement O
had O
been O
broken O
off O
after O
one B-CARDINAL
particular O
tiff O
, O
but O
denied O
that O
he O
owed O
Miss O
Camp B-PERSON
any O
money O
. O

All O
the O
while O
the O
police O
were O
casting O
about O
for O
a O
man O
who O
had O
been O
seen O
leaving O
the O
train O
at O
Wandsworth B-LOCATION
. O

A O
passenger O
described O
this O
individual O
as O
a O
man O
of O
about B-CARDINAL
thirty I-CARDINAL
, O
of O
medium O
height O
, O
with O
a O
dark O
moustache O
, O
and O
wearing O
a O
frockcoat O
and O
a O
top-hat O
. O

The O
porter O
at O
the O
station O
bore O
out O
this O
description O
, O
but O
the O
man O
was O
not O
traced O
. O

Perhaps O
the O
news O
of O
their O
search O
got O
around O
, O
for O
a O
man O
did O
obligingly O
present O
himself O
at O
Wandsworth B-LOCATION
police-station O
, O
claiming O
to O
have O
committed O
the O
murder O
- O
but O
he O
was O
mentally O
defective O
, O
and O
, O
despite O
his O
claim O
to O
infamy O
, O
had O
been O
nowhere O
near O
the O
7.42 B-CARDINAL
that B-TIME
evening I-TIME
. O

Even O
the O
bone O
cuff-links O
found O
beside O
the O
body O
, O
which O
had O
at O
first B-CARDINAL
been O
considered O
as O
belonging O
to O
the O
killer O
, O
proved O
yet O
another O
red O
herring O
, O
for O
it O
was O
learned O
that O
they O
had O
been O
borrowed O
by O
Elizabeth B-PERSON
Camp I-PERSON
from O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
her O
sisters O
. O

A O
young O
man O
from O
Reading B-LOCATION
named O
Marshall B-PERSON
had O
an O
uncomfortable O
time O
in O
the O
presence O
of O
the O
coroner O
. O

This O
man O
was O
known O
to O
have O
left O
his O
home O
on O
February B-TIME
11 I-TIME
, O
and O
to O
have O
been O
away O
for O
four B-TIME
days I-TIME
. O

Not O
in O
itself O
a O
crime O
, O
but O
, O
added O
to O
the O
knowledge O
that O
he O
had O
gone O
shopping O
in O
the O
town O
of O
Guil- B-LOCATION
dford I-LOCATION
for O
a O
false O
moustache O
, O
it O
left O
him O
with O
something O
to O
explain O
. O

His O
story O
was O
that O
he O
had O
left O
home O
to O
try O
to O
join O
the O
Army B-ORGANIZATION
( O
presumably O
feeling O
that O
a O
moustache O
might O
enhance O
his O
military O
bearing O
) O
, O
and O
this O
was O
accepted O
. O

And O
so O
the O
inquest O
, O
which O
had O
dragged O
on O
, O
with O
adjournments O
, O
until O
April B-TIME
7 I-TIME
, O
finally O
had O
to O
be O
content O
to O
return O
a O
verdict O
of O
" O
wilful O
murder O
against O
some O
person O
or O
persons O
unknown O
. O

" O
The O
most O
vital O
clue O
of O
the O
Wedgwood B-ORGANIZATION
pestle O
had O
been O
of O
no O
assistance O
. O

The O
killer O
must O
have O
been O
very O
thankful O
that O
the O
science O
of O
dactyloscopy O
was O
only O
in O
its O
beginnings O
. O

The O
next O
female O
fatality O
occurred O
eight B-TIME
years I-TIME
later I-TIME
, O
yet O
so O
strange O
were O
the O
circumstances O
that O
it O
was O
a B-TIME
further I-TIME
seven I-TIME
years I-TIME
before O
even O
a O
ghost O
of O
a O
solution O
emerged O
. O

There O
has O
always O
been O
something O
sinister O
in O
the O
idea O
of O
tunnels O
. O

The O
building O
of O
them O
was O
one O
of O
the O
most O
dangerous O
jobs O
con- O
nected O
with O
railway O
construction O
; O
and O
there O
were O
many O
people O
who O
believed O
that O
to O
travel O
through O
tunnels O
would O
be O
an O
equally O
hazardous O
business O
. O

Some O
thought O
that O
the O
result O
would O
be O
all O
sorts O
of O
horrible O
illnesses O
brought O
on O
by O
the O
confined O
atmosphere O
. O

" O
The O
shareholders O
who O
travel O
by O
it O
will O
be O
so O
heartily O
sick O
, O
what O
with O
the O
foul O
air O
, O
smoke O
and O
sulphur O
, O
that O
the O
mention O
of O
a O
railway O
will O
be O
worse O
than O
Ipecacuanha O
, O
" O
wrote O
an O
anti-railway O
industrialist O
when O
it O
was O
proposed O
to O
build O
the O
Box B-LOCATION
Tunnel I-LOCATION
. O

The O
mere O
thought O
of O
subterranean O
travel O
gave O
others O
a O
feeling O
of O
danger O
. O

A O
medical O
journal O
said O
, O
" O
the O
deafening O
peal O
of O
thunder O
, O
the O
sudden O
immersion O
in O
gloom O
, O
and O
the O
clash O
of O
reverberated O
sounds O
in O
a O
confined O
space O
combine O
to O
produce O
a O
momentary O
shudder O
, O
or O
idea O
of O
destruction O
, O
a O
thrill O
of O
annihilation O
. O

" O
It O
was O
also O
prophesied O
that O
passengers O
would O
be O
robbed O
and O
assaulted O
in O
the O
darkness O
. O

For O
all O
that O
, O
as O
far O
as O
England B-LOCATION
is O
concerned O
, O
there O
have O
been O
only B-CARDINAL
two I-CARDINAL
occasions O
on O
which O
a O
body O
has O
been O
found O
in O
a O
tunnel O
in O
circumstances O
pointing O
to O
murder O
. O

The O
first B-CARDINAL
was O
that O
of O
Mr O
Gold B-PERSON
, O
in O
the O
famous O
Lefroy B-PERSON
case O
, O
and O
by O
an O
odd O
chance O
the O
second B-CARDINAL
tragedy O
occurred O
on O
the O
same O
line O
, O
although O
this O
time O
the O
victim O
was O
a O
woman O
. O

Though O
in O
the O
minds O
of O
most O
people O
there O
was O
no O
doubt O
that O
the O
woman O
had O
been O
the O
victim O
of O
foul O
play O
, O
the O
verdict O
brought O
in O
was O
that O
there O
was O
not O
sufficient O
evidence O
to O
show O
whether O
she O
had O
fallen O
or O
been O
thrown O
from O
a O
train O
. O

The O
Merstham B-LOCATION
Tunnel I-LOCATION
, O
on O
the O
London-to- B-LOCATION
Brighton I-LOCATION
line O
, O
is O
approximately B-CARDINAL
one I-CARDINAL
mile O
long O
, O
and O
some O
time O
before B-TIME
midnight I-TIME
on I-TIME
September I-TIME
24 I-TIME

South I-ORGANIZATION
Coast I-ORGANIZATION
Railway I-ORGANIZATION
, O
It O
was O
the O
battered O
and O
broken O
body O
of O
a O
woman O
. O

He O
sent O
word O
straight O
away O
to O
near-by O
Merstham B-LOCATION
Station I-LOCATION
, O
and O
a O
stretcher O
party O
took O
the O
body O
to O
the O
Feathers B-LOCATION
Hotel I-LOCATION
to O
await O
identification O
. O

Was O
it O
a O
case O
of O
suicide O
, O
where O
some O
unhappy O
soul O
had O
walked O
deliberately O
into O
the O
blackness O
and O
into O
the O
path O
of O
some O
train O
? O

This O
hardly O
seemed O
likely O
, O
since O
, O
when O
she O
was O
examined O
by O
a O
local O
doctor O
, O
the O
woman O
, O
young O
, O
small O
, O
and O
rather O
plump O
, O
was O
found O
to O
have O
her O
own O
silk O
scarf O
drawn O
almost O
tight O
enough O
to O
strangle O
her O
, O
and O
the O
ends O
thrust O
in O
her O
mouth O
like O
a O
gag O
. O

Both O
her O
wrists O
bore O
the O
marks O
of O
severe O
bruising O
, O
and O
there O
were O
other O
injuries O
on O
her O
body O
which O
had O
occurred O
before O
her O
death O
was O
ensured O
by O
some O
train O
which O
had O
roared O
through O
the O
tunnel O
. O

There O
were O
no O
letters O
or O
papers O
found O
on O
her O
to O
assist O
identi O
fication O
, O
no O
money O
, O
and O
no O
railway O
ticket O
. O

By O
then O
reports O
were O
being O
gathered O
about O
all O
traffic O
over O
this O
stretch O
of O
line O
, O
but O
no O
information O
was O
forthcoming O
about O
any O
carriage O
with O
an O
open O
door O
, O
nor O
any O
passenger O
reporting O
an O
incident O
which O
might O
relate O
. O

So O
the O
body O
of O
this O
small O
girl O
with O
the O
blue O
eyes O
and O
long O
brown O
hair O
in O
a O
bun O
at O
the O
back O
of O
her O
head O
remained O
a O
mystery O
until O
later B-TIME
the I-TIME
following I-TIME
day I-TIME
. O

During O
that O
time O
a O
description O
of O
the O
girl O
was O
circulated O
, O
and O
a O
Mr O
Robert O
Money O
came O
forward O
to O
identify O
her O
as O
his O
sister O
, O
Mary B-PERSON
Money I-PERSON
, O
aged O
twenty-two B-TIME
. O

The O
girl O
, O
who O
was O
described O
as O
being O
" O
always O
bright O
and O
jolly O
, O
" O
had O
been O
unmarried O
, O
and O
lived O
at O
Lavender B-LOCATION

Clapham B-LOCATION
, O
on O
the O
premises O
of O
a O
dairyman O
, O
Bridger B-PERSON
, O
for O
whom O
she O
worked O
as O
a O
book-keeper O
. O

On O
the O
Sunday B-TIME
, O
the O
day O
of O
her O
death O
, O
she O
had O
gone O
out O
in O
the O
evening B-TIME
at O
about B-TIME
seven I-TIME
o'clock I-TIME
, O
telling O
her O
room-mate O
, O
Emma B-PERSON
Hone I-PERSON
, O
that O
she O
was O
going O
for O
a O
walk O
, O
but O
would O
not O
be O
gone O
for O
long O
. O

According O
to O
Miss O
Hone B-PERSON
, O
she O
had O
not O
been O
carrying O
a O
handbag O
, O
but O
she O
believed O
she O
had O
had O
a O
small O
purse O
. O

At O
Clapham B-LOCATION
Junction I-LOCATION
a O
ticket-collector O
was O
able O
to O
identify O
a O
photograph O
of O
the O
girl O
, O
and O
he O
said O
he O
had O
last O
seen O
her O
on O
platform O
six B-CARDINAL
waiting O
to O
board O
a O
train O
for O
the O
short O
run O
to O
Victoria B-LOCATION
. O

A O
passenger O
at O
Victoria B-LOCATION
said O
he O
had O
seen O
a O
young O
lady O
" O
as O
near O
as O
possible O
" O
like O
the O
photograph O
shown O
him O
, O
with O
a O
man O
" O
very O
close O
in O
conversation O
and O
walking O
arm O
in O
arm O
. O

" O
A O
guard O
reported O
that O
at O
East B-LOCATION
Croydon I-LOCATION
he O
had O
seen O
what O
was O
accepted O
as O
the O
same O
couple O
sitting O
close O
together O
in O
a O
first-class B-CARDINAL
compartment O
of O
the O
train O
from O
London B-LOCATION
Bridge I-LOCATION
of O
which O
he O
was O
in O
charge O
. O

The O
two B-CARDINAL
could O
have O
joined O
this O
train O
by O
taking O
one O
from O
Victoria B-LOCATION
and O
changing O
at O
East B-LOCATION
Croydon I-LOCATION
. O

He O
also O
believed O
that O
they O
had O
still O
been O
together O
at O
South B-LOCATION
Croydon I-LOCATION
, O
and O
he O
remembered O
Medical O
evidence O
established O
that O
Mary B-PERSON
Money I-PERSON
had O
been O
dead O
for O
about B-TIME
an I-TIME
hour I-TIME
before O
her O
body O
was O
discovered O
, O
and O
this O
matched O
reasonably O
well O
with O
the O
timetable O
of O
the O
train O
in O
question O

evidence O
came O
from O
a O
signalman O
at O
Purley B-LOCATION
Oaks I-LOCATION

who O
had O
seen O

as O
the O

passed O
his O
box O

a O
couple O
struggling O
in O
a O
first-class B-CARDINAL
compartment O
; O
but O
he O
seemed O
to O
have O
been O
used O
to O
seeing O
couples O
engaged O
in O
In O
those B-TIME
early I-TIME
years I-TIME
1914-18 I-TIME
, O
life O
was O
very O
full O
both O
in O
the O

in O
the O

The O
Bishop O
, O
knowing O
that O
I O
spent O
my O
holidays O
in O
Bavaria B-LOCATION

asked O
me O
if O
I O
would O
do O
something O
for O
two B-CARDINAL
wards O
at O
the O
Royal B-LOCATION
Herbert I-LOCATION
Hospital I-LOCATION

full O
of O
war O
prisoners O

I O
was O
very O
glad O
to O
help O
in O
this O
way O
, O
and O
visited O
them O
frequently O
, O
establishing O
at O
once O
a O
friendly O
contact O
with O
the O
Bavarian B-NORP
wounded O
who O
were O
delighted O
to O
find O
someone O
who O
knew O
their O
native O
villages O

I O
could O
at O
once O
notice O
the O
great O
antagonism O
between O
the O
Bavarians B-NORP
and O
the O
Prussians B-NORP
who O
openly O
scorned O
these O
more O
simple O
country O
folk O

had O
our O

led O
us O
in O
this O
matter O

the O

that O
we O
had O
contemplated O
the O

very O
special O
precautions O

the O
lives O
of O
our O

Particular O
hatred O
, O
we O
felt O

was O
bound O
to O
be O
aimed O
at O
the O

of O
those O

spread O
such O
ghastly O
havoc O

destruction O

, O
drawing-in O
great O
breaths O
that O
became O
great O
sighs O
of O
ecstacy O
. O

" O
They O
have O
come O
! O

" O
he O
said O
reverently O
, O
gripping O
his O
hands O
together O
between O
his O
knees O
and O
leaning O
forward O
. O

" O
Isn't O
it O
a O
glorious O
thing O
! O

Long O
awaited O
transcendent O
event O
, O
the O
exalted O
desire O
of O
all O
mankind O
through O
all O
ages O
! O

The O
Kingdom O
of O
the O
Mind O
is O
at O
hand O
! O

" O
He O
turned O
beaming O
eyes O
upward O
and O
shook O
his O
head O
slowly O
from O
side O
to O
side O
. O

A O
superfluous O
precaution O
for O
there O
was O
no O
other O
car O
abroad O
; O
and O
no O
pedestrian O
to O
cross O
his O
path O
nor O
to O
wait O
at O
an O
intersection O
for O
the O
light O
to O
change O
. O

At O
his O
apartment O
he O
garaged O
his O
car O
and O
then O
stood O
listening O
in O
the O
night O
. O

Listening O
in O
vain O
. O

For O
the O
earth O
had O
lost O
its O
life-tempo O
, O
as O
the O
heart O
loses O
its O
beat O
in O
death O
. O

After O
what O
seemed O
an O
undue O
period O
of O
repetition O
, O
the O
voice O
went O
on O
to O
describe O
the O
landing O
of O
the O
Thetan B-LOCATION
colony O
in O
Sussex B-LOCATION
, O
in O
all O
its O
obscene O
details O
. O

Then O
the O
radio O
went O
dead O
again O
, O
and O
Steve B-PERSON
had O
no O
stomach O
for O
breakfast O
. O

It O
was O
a O
beautiful O
day O
, O
as O
firsts-of-June B-TIME
should O
be O
. O

Steve B-PERSON
got O
out O
the O
car O
and O
traversed O
the O
same O
empty O
streets O
as O
he O
had O
the O
night B-TIME
before O
, O
to O
keep O
an O
appointment O
with O
Heather B-PERSON
. O

" O
The O
Thetans B-NORP
, O
" O
he O
said O
, O
" O
are O
presumably O
here O
to O
take O
charge O
, O
as O
it O
were O
, O
of O
the O
minds O
of O
the O
people O
- O
who O
are O
probably O
falling O
all O
over O
them- O
selves O
in O
their O
zeal O
to O
get O
their O
orders O
and O
to O
carry O
them O
out O
. O

Just O
what O
these O
orders O
will O
be O
, O
we O
don't O
know O
. O

Now O
, O
because O
of O
prior O
hypnosis O
we O
have O
es- O
caped O
Thetan B-LOCATION
subjugation O
. O

This O
time O
. O

But O
we O
no O
longer O
have O
any O
immunity O
. O

There O
can O
be O
little O
doubt O
that O
if O
the O
Thetans B-NORP
discover O
our O
mental O
independence O
they O
will O
promptly O
give O
us O
their O
hypnotic O
treatment O
. O

If O
we O
can O
avoid O
undue O
prominence O
, O
it O
may O
be O
that O
we O
can O
move O
about O
pretty O
freely O
without O
detection O
. O

If O
we O
can O
- O
well O
, O
then O
we O
may O
be O
able O
to O
promote O
our O
own O
interests O
. O

What O
those O
interests O
are O
, O
beyond O
personal O
security O
, O
I O
haven't O
a O
clue O
; O
but O
, O
who O
knows O
, O
we O
may O
form O
the O
nucleus O
around O
... O
" O
Now O
, O
to O
summarize O
what O
I O
think O
our O
course O
of O
action O
should O
be O
. O

First B-CARDINAL
, O
to O
avoid O
the O
Thetans B-NORP
like O
the O
plague O
, O
for O
they O
must O
not O
find O
us O
out O
! O

Second B-CARDINAL
, O
to O
tread O
pretty O
warily O
among O
our O
own O
people O
, O
finding O
out O
just O
how O
much O
freedom O
we O
can O
take O
with O
safety O
. O

And O
third B-CARDINAL
, O
to O
study O
these O
damned O
Thetans B-NORP
. O

We O
must O
learn O
all O
we O
can O
about O
them O
. O

There O
is O
just O
a O
hope O
that O
we O
may O
uncover O
some O
weakness O
, O
and O
find O
a O
way O
of O
fighting O
back O
at O
them O
. O

" O
Heather B-PERSON
agreed O
, O
and O
suggested O
that O
they O
use O
Dan B-PERSON
as O
a O
specimen O
demonstra- O
ting O
how O
the O
Thetan B-LOCATION
machinations O
had O
been O
working O
out O
. O

It O
occurred O
to O
Steve B-PERSON
that O
this O
may O
not O
have O
been O
entirely O
an O
objective O
suggestion O
on O
her O
part O
; O
but O
he O
thought O
it O
a O
good O
idea O
nevertheless O
. O

So O
they O
proceeded O
to O
see O
if O
the O
coast O
was O
clear O
. O

The O
street O
was O
quiet O
and O
deserted O
, O
and O
there O
were O
neither O
sight O
nor O
sound O
of O
flying O
saucers O
. O

So O
they O
ventured O
forth O
and O
made O
their O
way O
on O
foot O
to O
Dan's B-PERSON
house O
. O

Dan B-PERSON
came O
to O
the O
door O
at O
their O
ring O
but O
neglected O
to O
offer O
any O
greeting O
. O

He O
was O
deeply O
preoccupied O
, O
and O
it O
seemed O
that O
the O
ringing O
of O
a O
doorbell O
was O
to O
him O
a O
new O
and O
strange O
phenomenon O
. O

When O
he O
finally O
beckoned O
to O
them O
to O
enter O
, O
the O
action O
gave O
the O
impression O
of O
having O
been O
thought O
out O
and O
decided O
upon O
. O

Inside O
they O
sat O
down O
unbidden O
, O
while O
Dan B-PERSON
paced O
the O
floor O
. O

He O
seemed O
completely O
unaware O
of O
their O
presence O
. O

They O
just O
stared O
at O
him O
, O
turning O
their O
heads O
like O
tennis O
spectators O
as O
he O
walked O
up O
and O
down O
, O
up O
and O
down O
. O

Then O
he O
would O
go O
back O
to O
Plato B-LOCATION
for O
a O
final O
spell O
of O
real O
days O
and O
would O
return O
to O
New B-LOCATION
York I-LOCATION
in O
late B-TIME
January I-TIME
or O
early B-TIME
February I-TIME
. O

Angelina B-PERSON
might O
be O
a O
little O
sorry O
if O
we O
were O
not O
back O
for O
Christmas B-TIME
as O
arranged O
, O
but O
he O
consoled O
himself O
by O
thinking O
that O
he O
and O
Angelina B-PERSON
would O
have O
plenty O
of O
time O
together O
in O
the O
future O
. O

And O
Heaven O
alone O
knew O
when O
, O
if O
ever O
, O
he O
would O
be O
back O
on O
Moon B-LOCATION
again O
, O
and O
able O
to O
do O
research O
at O
first B-CARDINAL
hand O
into O
matters O
on O
which O
the O
future O
of O
everyone O
, O
including O
Angelina B-PERSON
, O
depended O
... O
The O
recovery O
of O
his O
balance O
was O
due O
to O
the O
fact O
that O
he O
was O
living O
, O
virtually O
without O
expenses O
, O
with O
the O
people O
to O
whom O
Moke B-PERSON
had O
sent O
him O
: O
little O
people O
who O
regarded O
him O
as O
lucky O
to O
have O
descended O
from O
such O
economic O
altitudes O
. O

Tom B-PERSON

had O
a O

on O

in O
the O
Secretariat B-ORGANIZATION
( O
Stamp B-ORGANIZATION

while O
Sally B-PERSON
sulked O
at O

Sometimes O
she O
took O
Harry B-PERSON
around O
with O
her O
, O
but O
never O
her O
husband O
, O
a O
fact O
he O
accepted O
as O
inevitable O
. O

" O
I O
guess O
Sally B-PERSON
made O
a O
mistake O
about O
me O
, O
" O
he O
said O
one B-TIME
evening I-TIME
, O
when O
he O
had O
been O
left O
to O
cook O
his O
own O
meal O
. O

All O
Sally's B-PERSON
relations O
were O

was O
a O

All B-PERSON
Aristotle I-PERSON
was O
excited O
at O
the O
time O
, O
not O
by O
the O
prospect O
of O
the O
U.S. B-LOCATION
President's O
visit O
, O
but O
by O
a O
great O
storm O
in O
the O
photo- O
sphere O
of O
the O
sun B-LOCATION
. O

A O
matter O
which O
on O
Earth B-LOCATION
would O
hardly O
penetrate O
beyond O
the O
minds O
of O
astronomers O
was O
of O
general O
interest O
to O
the O
Mos B-ORGANIZATION
, O
doubtless O
because O
their O
habitat O
is O
not O
submerged O
beneath O
a O
deep O
natural O
atmosphere O
. O

Lester B-PERSON
was O
not O
home O
yet O
from O
his O
formidable O
duties O
and O
his O
wife O
, O
in O
the O
manner O
of O
middle-brow O
wives O
, O
romanced O
about O
him O
in O
his O
absence O
. O

" O
Lester B-PERSON
was O
a O
country O
lawyer O
, O
and O
we O
were O
very O
small O
4microdebs O
, O
weren't O
we O

Sally B-PERSON
" O
- O
here O
she O
had O
dropped O
her O
voice O
in O
homage O
to O
the O
economic O
system O
: O
that O
was O
reverenced O
- O
" O
when O
he O

how O
he O
did O
it O
? O

He O
's O

So O
when O
he O
visited O
some O
craterlet O
on O
Face O
( O
ours O
is O
an O
agricultural O
Back-Face O
area O
) O
the O
cry O
would O
go O
up O
, O
as O
soon O
as O
he O
had O
spoken O
a O
few O
sentences O
of O
his O
speech O
: O
' O
Cut O

how O

how O
we O
came O
through O
to O
4makrodeb O
status O
and O
got O
all O
these O
lovely O
things O
" O
- O
she O
waved O
a O
plump O
hand O
towards O
her O
grand O
pianos O
, O
etc O
: O
at O
the O
same O
time O
a O
door O
banged O

" O
but O
don't O
say O
a O
word O
about O
it O
, O
Lester B-PERSON
wants O
his O
mouth-organ O
to O
be O
forgotten O
now O
. O

The O
time O
has O
come O
for O
him O
to O
be O
taken O
seriously O
as O
a O
statesman O
. O

" O
The O
political O
life O
of O
Aristotle B-PERSON
looked O
more O
and O
more O
like O
a O
masquerade O
of O
business O
interests O
in O
dis- O
guise O
which O
, O
far O
from O
attracting O
the O
allegiance O
of O
free O
men O
everywhere O
, O
could O
only O
repel O
them O
. O

Then O
what O
of O
the O
cultural O
life O
? O

Did O
this O
per- O
haps O
nurture O
a O
genuinely O
civilizing O
impulse O
which O
might O
in O
time O
become O
social O
fact O
and O
counteract O
the O
obsession O
with O
economics O
which O
had O
grown O
up O
during O
the O
Moon's B-LOCATION
first B-CARDINAL
two B-TIME
centuries I-TIME
? O

At O
the O
centre O
of O
each O
circle O
stood O
personnel O
managers O
of O
corporations O
, O
together O
with O
professors O
and O
their O
filing O
clerks O
. O

The O
students O
had O
bought O
their O
college O
education O
forward O
and O
were O
now O
being O
bought O
forward O
in O
their O
turn O
. O

By O
comparing O
personal O
appearances O
with O
university O
records O
, O
the O
agents O
of O
the O
businesses O
would O
pick O
on O
young O
men O
and O
women O
who O
interested O
them O
, O
and O
contracts O
would O
be O
initialled O
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
parade O
. O

But O
since O
starting O
salaries O
would O
depend O
on O
grade O
A O
or O
B O
in O
the O
finals O
next B-TIME
May I-TIME
, O
and O
since O
mating O
prospects O
would O
depend O
upon O
salaries O
, O
scholarship O
for O
these O
fine O
young O
people O
was O
closely O
geared O
to O
economic O
and O
biological O
ends O
which O
, O
essentially O
, O
were O
really O
means O
. O

So O
, O
seeing O
them O
revolve O
in O
circles O
, O
Harry B-PERSON
had O
the O
feeling O
that O
Moke B-PERSON
( O
or O
what O
Moke B-PERSON
consciously O
or O
unconsciously O
symbolised O
, O
any- O
way O
in O
Harry's B-PERSON
mind O
) O
had O
these O
splendid O
young O
people O
by O
the O
short O
hairs O
, O
and O
was O
diverting O
them O
... O
So O
once O
again O
the O
metaphysics O
were O
depressing O
, O
and O
in O
absolute O
contrast O
to O
the O
physical O
display O
. O

Mos B-ORGANIZATION

an O
un-American B-NORP
love O
of O

on O

for O
jobs O
which O
they O
had O
to O
get O

pay O
off O

, O

naturally O
putting O

' O
Something O

up O

said O
Lord O

carefully O
casual O

' O
The O

all O
on O

did O
you O
notice O
? O

And O
the O

' O
He O
peered O

' O
Think O
there O

Indians B-NORP
about O
? O

' O
It O
was O
most O
certainly O
an O
eerie O
night B-TIME
, O
exceptionally O
brilliant O
and O
strange O
, O
for O
in O
the O
proximity O
of O
the O
mountains O
, O
whose O
presence O
I O
could O
almost O
smell O
, O
' O
Bottle-Foot O

my O
lord O

' O
' O
Bottle-Foot O
? O

' O
His O
lordship O
may O
have O
thought O
I O
had O
become O
unbalanced O
through O
fear O
. O

' O
A O
character O
Mr O
Gilberto B-PERSON
mentioned O
to O
other O
day O
, O
my O
lord O
. O

A O
being O
of O
whom O
the O
forest O
Indians B-NORP
are O
said O
to O
be O
mortally O
afraid O
, O
with O
a O
hoof O
shaped O
like O
the O
heel O
of O
a O
bottle O
. O

If O
your O
lordship O
will O
excuse O
me O
a O
moment O
... O
' O
I O
had O
a O
distinct O
impression O
that O
the O
hut O
had O
recently O
been O
cleaned O
and O
prepared O
for O
visitors O
. O

Mrs O
Caine B-PERSON
said O
we O
were O
to O
go O
no O
further O
unless O
and O
until O
we O
were O
sent O
for O
, O
confirming O
another O
impression O
that O
became O
more O
and O
more O
definite O
, O
namely O
, O
that O
she O
was O
in O
touch O
with O
an O
invi- O
sible O
source O
of O
authority O
. O

Sally B-PERSON
and O
of O
course O
Mrs O
Septimus B-PERSON
, O
for O
surely O
Mr O
Septimus B-PERSON
stood O
in O
the O
same O
case O
as O
myself O
? O

But O
was O
it O
so O
? O

I O
allowed O
myself O
to O
entertain O
for O
an O
instant O
the O
idea O
, O
the O
strange O
, O
the O
unwelcome O
, O
the O
almost O
inconceivable O
idea O
, O
that O
Ariadne's B-PERSON
arrival O
would O
be O
inopportune O
; O
and O
with O
the O
idea O
came O
a O
somewhat O
vulgar O
impulse O
, O
which O
I O
refused O
, O
to O
watch O
Mr O
Septimus B-PERSON
more O
closely O
, O
Mrs O
Caine B-PERSON
too O
and O
Mr O
Gilberto B-PERSON
who O
would O
... O
But O
all O
three B-CARDINAL
were O
to O
the O
casual O
observation O
I O
permitted O
myself O
unruffled O
; O
Mr O
Septimus B-PERSON
reserved O
and O
certainly O
very O
thoughtful O
, O
but O
that O
was O
his O
habit O
. O

Indeed O
we O
were O
all O
invaded O
by O
a O
most O
tranquil O
mood O
. O

Even O
the O
Indian B-NORP
servants O
relaxed O
, O
knowing O
, O
so O
Mr O
Gilberto B-PERSON
told O
us O
, O
that O
the O
wild O
and O
savage O
tribes O
never O
approached O
this O
region O
: O
at O
any O
rate O
they O
remained O
with O
us O
, O
perhaps O
for O
such O
protection O
as O
our O
presence O
, O
or O
Mrs O
But O
after O
what O
Mrs O
Caine B-PERSON
had O
said O
it O
was O
never O
far O
from O
our O
minds O
that O
at O
any O
moment O
we O
were O
to O
receive O
a O
summons O
. O

I O
could O
see O
that O
Mr O
Septimus B-PERSON
was O
impatient O
for O
it O
. O

This B-TIME
afternoon I-TIME
, O
then O
, O
we O
climbed O
a O
promontory O
, O
a O
mass O
of O
clean O
rock O
crowned O
with O
trees O
and O
bushes O
, O
that O
stood O
well O
out O
over O
the O

For O
the O
two-twenty B-CARDINAL
carried O
, O
for O
him O
, O
a O
cargo O
more O
precious O
than O

Though O
Mofydd B-PERSON
Owen I-PERSON
was O
, O
as O
he O
feared O
, O
departed O
out O
of O
his O

he O
still O
loved O

Already O
, O
even O
as O
with O
trembling O

he O
fastened O
his O

he O
was O
seeing O
her O

But O
even O
his O
imagination O
, O
luckily O
for O
him O
, O
did O
not O
visualise O
the O
awful O
truth O
- O
that O
Morfyyd B-PERSON

already O

Where O

Mam B-PERSON

" O
inquired O
little O
Cadwallader B-PERSON
when O
his O
child O

grasped O
the O
fact O
that O
the O

falling O

Where O
indeed O
? O

Megan B-PERSON
Thomas I-PERSON
spoke O
sharply O
to O
the O
conductor O
, O
demanding O
an O
explanation O
. O

But O
nonplussed O
, O
the O
conductor O
was O
. O

A O
good O
man O
, O

; O
knew O
his O

out O
of O

Fingered O

Peered O
out O

Went O

consulted O
the O

" O
Where O

" O
he O
echoed O
Cadwallader B-PERSON

" O
Damned O
if O

" O
said O
the O

" O

something O

if O
you O

" O
Immersed O

was O
the O
Rev. O

Now O
he O
put O
down O
his O

folded O
it O
, O
and O
glanced O
idly O
out O
of O
the O

Looked O
again O
, O
eyes O
starting O
from O
his O

. O

" O
God O

" O
he O
cried O

" O
Never O

tartly O

" O

Mr. O

But O

" O
Morfydd B-PERSON
Owen I-PERSON
was O
silent O
. O

But O
she O
looked O
down O
at O
the O
fast-disappearing O
earth O
, O
and O
it O
seemed O
to O
her O
that O
she O
would O
never O
see O
her O
Dai B-PERSON

. O

And O
though O
half B-TIME
an I-TIME

she O
had O
regarded O
this O
possibility O
with O
fortitude O
, O
it O
now O
filled O
her O
with O
dismay O
. O

Quietly O
she O
began O
to O
weep O
... O
Dai B-PERSON

meanwhile O
, O
was O
pedalling O
furiously O
on O
the O

Not O
a O

He O
passed O
The B-LOCATION

At O
last O
he O
caught O
up O
Mr. O

walking O
very O
dogged O
towards O

" O

Mr. O

he O
called O

His O
spirits O
were O
rising O

He O
had O
seen O
no O

Therefore O
Mr. O

would O
find O

his O

quietly O

thought O
of O

The O
Rev. O
Edwards B-PERSON
, O
standing O
at O
the O
front O
, O
looked O
at O
his O
forlorn O
flock O
. O

" O
What O
about O
a O
verse O
or O
two B-CARDINAL
of O
Cwm O
Rhondda O
? O

" O
he O
suggested O
hopefully O
. O

They O
looked O
at O
him O
, O
sullen O
. O

His O
heart O
sank O
. O

If O
the O
Welsh B-NORP
found O
the O
situation O
too O
desperate O
for O
singing O
, O
then O
the O
situation O
, O
he O
realised O
, O
must O
be O
desperate O
indeed O
. O

But O
suddenly O
they O
were O
roused O
from O
their O
lethargy O
. O

Something O
was O
approaching O
, O
faster O
, O
faster O
, O
a O
tearing O
hurrying O
blur O
that O
was O
past O
and O
gone O
in O
a O
moment O
, O
followed O
by O
a O
great O
rush O
of O
sound O
. O

They O
waved O
frantically O
. O

But O
the O
jet O
aircraft O
was O
already O
miles O
away O
, O
swinging O
down O
to O
the O
darkening O
earth O
. O

" O
It O
passed O
me O
at O
fifty B-CARDINAL
thousand I-CARDINAL

Llewelyn B-PERSON
Jones I-PERSON

looked O
keenly O
at O
the O
Flying O

had O
burst O
so O
unceremoniously O
into O
his O
office O
. O

" O
And O
what O
did O
it O
look O
like O
, O
Broughtons B-PERSON
? O

Some O
sort O
of O

? O

" O
Flying O
Officer O
Broughtons B-PERSON
shuffled O
his O
feet O
. O

" O
Well O
, O
actually O
, O
sir O
, O
it O
looked O
like O

like O
a O

A O
single-decker O

" O
he O
elaborated O

the O

looked O
. O

" O
Broughtons B-PERSON

" O
he O
said O
silkily O
. O

" O
Didn't O
they O
teach O
you O

" O
Very O
pale O
, O
Broughtons B-PERSON
was O
. O

But O
determined O
. O

" O
It O
was O
a O
bus O
, O
sir O
. O

They O
'd O
got O
the O

on O

There O
were O

" O

" O
Oh O
, O
very O
caustic O

that O

But O
Broughtons B-PERSON
stood O
his O

. O

" O
No O

" O
Llewelyn B-PERSON
Jones I-PERSON
sat O
back O
in O
his O
chair O
. O

" O
I O
see O

So O
you O
met O
a O

at O
fifty B-CARDINAL

All O
lit O
up O
. O

Full O
of O
people O
waving O
as O
you O
went O
past O

" O
Suddenly O
he O
crouched O
forward O
. O

" O
Broughtons B-PERSON
, O
if O
I O
thought O
there O
were O
anything O
in O
Queen's O
Regulations O

I O
'd O
have O
you O
court-martialled O

But O
I O
know O
there O

" O
he O
ended O
sadly O
. O

" O
I O
tried O
to O
read O
the O
registration O
number O
, O
sir O
. O

But O
it O
was O
getting O
dark O
. O

" O
He O
waited O
. O

But O
his O
commanding O
officer O
appeared O
to O
have O
forgotten O
him O
. O

" O
Then O
we O
are O
saved O
, O
" O
cried O
the O
Rev. O
Edwards B-PERSON
. O

Shyly O
, O
Morfydd B-PERSON
Owen I-PERSON
produced O
a O
block O
of O
chocolate O
. O

Alastair B-PERSON
was O
a O
bachelor O
. O

All O
his O
life O
he O
had O
been O
inclined O
to O
regard O
women O
as O
something O
which O
must O
necessarily O
be O
subordinated O
to O
his O
career O
. O

Now O
he O
realised O
that O
he O
was O
entrusting O
not O
only O
his O
own O
life O
, O
but O
Geoffrey's B-PERSON
as O
well O
, O
to O
a O
strange O
girl O
whom O
he O
had O
never O
met O
and O
on O
whom O
after O
no O
more O
than O
a O
couple O
of O
telephone O
calls O
he O
was O
prepared O
to O
place O
complete O
reliance O
. O

It O
was O
a O
novel O
experience O
. O

Alastair B-PERSON
was O
quite O
unable O
to O
explain O
why O
he O
should O
feel O
so O
much O
confidence O
in O
her O
. O

Once O
again O
she O
checked O
back O
her O
instructions O
. O

It O
was O
obvious O
that O
she O
did O
not O
fail O
to O
appreciate O
the O
faith O
which O
he O
was O
placing O
in O
her O
and O
was O
prepared O
to O
accept O
the O
responsibility O
. O

" O
Good O
luck O
, O
Air O
Marshal O
, O
" O
she O
said O
gently O
. O

" O
I O
'll O
be O
waiting O
for O
you O
at O
the O
Hotel B-LOCATION
Roma I-LOCATION
at O
six B-TIME
this I-TIME
evening I-TIME
- O
and O
I O
shall O
look O
forward O
to O
meeting O
you O
both O
at O
midnight B-TIME
. O

" O
They O
might O
have O
been O
arranging O
a O
supper O
party O
. O

Then O
she O
rang O
off O
. O

Alastair B-PERSON
admitted O
that O
never O
in O
a O
not O
altogether O
uneventful O
life O
had O
he O
come O
across O
a O
girl O
who O
sounded O
so O
charming O
and O
appeared O
to O
be O
so O
efficient O
. O

For O
some O
reason O
the O
orderlies O
had O
forgotten O
to O
switch O
on O
the O
lights O
; O
there O
was O
no O
colour O
- O
physical O
features O
were O
distinguishable O
solely O
by O
gradations O
of O
silvery O
greyness O
. O

Even O
the O
snow- O
capped O
summit O
of O
Mont B-LOCATION
Blanc I-LOCATION
, O
seven B-CARDINAL
miles O
below O
, O
was O
not O
recognisable O
among O
the O
host O
of O
lower O
peaks O
. O

The O
screen O
of O
the O
air-to-air O
radar O
glowed O
. O

Occasionally O
minute O
spots O
flickered O
across O
its O
surface O
, O
but O
there O
was O
no O
permanent O
image O
. O

In O
the O
exceptional O
clarity O
he O
was O
even O
able O
to O
make O
a O
direct O
comparison O
between O
the O
radar O
image O
and O
the O
ground O
itself O
. O

Ahead O
lay O
the O
Plain B-LOCATION
of I-LOCATION
Lombardy I-LOCATION
; O
to O
the O
right O
, O
Turin B-LOCATION
; O
to O
the O
left O
, O
Milan B-LOCATION
. O

The O
directional O
angle O
of O
the O
scanner O
could O
be O
adjusted O
to O
cover O
any O
particular O
area O
within O
its O
range O
. O

Geoffrey B-PERSON
turned O
the O
scale O
slowly O
to O
cover O
the O
ground O
immediately O
ahead O
. O

He O
was O
able O
to O
pick O
out O
towns O
, O
unrecognisable O
to O
the O
naked O
eye O
, O
obscured O
by O
the O
ground O
haze O
which O
even O
on O
the O
clearest O
night B-TIME
limited O
angular O
vision O
. O

He O
glanced O
at O
the O
speed O
recorder O
. O

It O
seemed O
almost O
incredible O
that O
the O
tiny O
white O
figure O
of O
8.5 B-CARDINAL
against O
which O
the O
needle O
was O
resting O
could O
really O
mean O
hundreds B-CARDINAL
of O
knots O
. O

Now O
, O
as O
Alastair B-PERSON
reduced O
the O
thrust O
, O
the O
pitch O
changed O
as O
the O
nose O
of O
the O
aircraft O
dipped O
slightly O
. O

The O
needle O
of O
the O
speed O
recorder O
swung O
gently O
through O
8.0 B-CARDINAL
, O
7.0 B-CARDINAL
, O
6.0 B-CARDINAL
before O
coming O
to O
rest O
at O
5.0 B-CARDINAL
. O

" O
We O
're O
a O
bit O
ahead O
of O
time O
, O
" O
said O
Alastair B-PERSON
. O

" O
We O
'll O
run O
in O
on O
minimum O
engine O
power O
. O

" O
Geoffrey B-PERSON
smiled O
. O

Alastair B-PERSON
talked O
of O
running O
in O
when O
they O
were O
still O
more B-CARDINAL
than I-CARDINAL
four I-CARDINAL
hundred I-CARDINAL
miles O
from O
their O
destination O
. O

They O
were O
nearing O
Modena B-LOCATION
. O

Geoffrey B-PERSON
focused O
the O
radar O
scanner O
on O
the O
bridge O
over O
the O
Po B-LOCATION
, O
barely B-CARDINAL
forty I-CARDINAL
miles O
to O
port O
. O

He O
was O
able O
to O
trace O
the O
course O
of O
the O
river O
; O
he O
thought O
he O
could O
recognise O
the O
route O
of O
N12 B-LOCATION
, O
along O
which O
he O
had O
motored O
so O
desperately O
little B-TIME
more I-TIME
than I-TIME
twenty-four I-TIME
hours I-TIME
earlier O
. O

Since O
then O
he O
had O
flown O
to O
England B-LOCATION
, O
attended O
the O
vital O
conference O
in O
Bruce B-PERSON
Denton's I-PERSON
office O
, O
been O
whisked O
by O
special O
helicopter O
from O
the O
Horse B-LOCATION
Guards I-LOCATION
Parade I-LOCATION
to O
Boscombe B-LOCATION
Down I-LOCATION
, O
slept O
for O
six B-TIME
blessed I-TIME
refreshing I-TIME
hours I-TIME
and O
had O
now O
completed O
two-thirds B-CARDINAL
of O
the O
journey O
back O
to O
the O
place O
where O
every O
indication O
pointed O
to O
Eve B-PERSON
being O
held O
. O

Geoffrey B-PERSON
set O
himself O
to O
consider O
the O
movements O
of O
the O
Bentley O
. O

It O
had O
passed O
him O
at O
the O
temporary O
bridge O
over O
the O
Tartaro B-LOCATION
at O
a B-TIME
few I-TIME
minutes I-TIME
past I-TIME
ten I-TIME
on O
the B-TIME
previous I-TIME
night I-TIME
. O

He O
worked O
out O
the O
distance O
on O
the O
presumption O
that O
its O
route O
had O
been O
through O
Florence B-LOCATION
and O
Rome B-LOCATION
and O
then O
across O
Italy B-LOCATION
via O
Foggia B-LOCATION
to O
Barletta B-LOCATION
. O

It O
came O
to O
just B-CARDINAL
over I-CARDINAL
six I-CARDINAL
hundred I-CARDINAL
miles O
. O

DARKNESS O
had O
descended O
like O
a O
curtain O
by O
the O
time O
they O
docked O
at O
Belleray B-LOCATION
. O

And O
though O
Guy B-PERSON
, O
made O
nervous O
by O
Beryl's B-PERSON
silence O
, O
drove O
at O
reckless O
speed O
to O
the O
Villa O
, O
it O
was O
quickly O
evident O
that O
the O
party O
was O
over O
. O

Piers B-PERSON
came O
strolling O
out O
to O
meet O
the O
Deanes B-PERSON
, O
and O
as O
soon O
as O
Guy B-PERSON
had O
driven O
away O
, O
invited O
them O
casually O
to O
come O
to O
his O
flat O
for O
a O
drink O
. O

To O
Beryl B-PERSON
, O
at O
least O
, O
this O
was O
anti-climax O
with O
a O
vengeance O
. O

She O
had O
expected O
to O
be O
met O
with O
violent O
reproaches O
- O
and O
here O
he O
was O
bland O
and O
smiling O
. O

But O
it O
did O
not O
take O
her O
long O
to O
realise O
that O
his O
mood O
was O
less O
pleasant O
than O
appeared O
on O
the O
surface O
. O

He O
told O
her O
nonchalantly O
, O
as O
he O
led O
the O
way O
to O
his O
own O
veranda O
, O
that O
he O
had O
taken O
the O
liberty O
of O
asking O
Jack B-PERSON
- O
as O
a O
representative O
of O
the O
Vallin B-PERSON
family O
- O
to O
come O
over O
and O
make O
the O
presentation O
in O
her O
stead O
. O

" O
I O
caught O
him O
just O
as O
he O
was O
going O
to O
the O
airport O
to O
meet O
Blanche B-PERSON
, O
" O
he O
said O
. O

" O
As O
a O
matter O
of O
fact O
I O
'd O
asked O
him O
last B-TIME
night I-TIME
to O
deputise O
for O
me O
and O
fetch O
her O
. O

He O
brought O
her O
to O
the O
party O
too O
. O

They O
're O
both O
here O
. O

" O
" O
I O
didn't O
know O
she O
was O
coming O
back O
from O
Barbados B-LOCATION
so O
soon O
. O

" O
Beryl B-PERSON
said O
the O
first B-CARDINAL
thing O
that O
came O
into O
her O
head O
. O

" O
Oh O
, O
she O
was O
due O
! O

" O
And O
then O
he O
added O
in O
the O
same O
casual O
tone O
, O
" O
She O
's O
not O
returning O
to O
her O
family O
. O

She O
's O
going O
to O
live O
with O
friends O
of O
the O
bank O
manager O
, O
just O
this O
side O
of O
Belleray B-LOCATION
. O

" O
Mrs. O
Deane B-PERSON
made O
a O
suitable O
comment O
, O
but O
Beryl B-PERSON
said O
nothing O
. O

She O
was O
trying O
to O
sort O
things O
out O
in O
her O
mind O
. O

That O
beneath O
his O
unnaturally O
smooth O
exterior O
Piers B-PERSON
was O
simmering O
with O
anger O
against O
her O
she O
had O
no O
doubt O
. O

Jack B-PERSON
and O
Blanche B-PERSON
were O
quick O
to O
sympathise O
, O
and O
to O
express O
their O
disgust O
at O
Sir O
John's B-PERSON
abominable O
treatment O
of O
his O
guests O
. O

But O
Piers B-PERSON
remained O
aloof O
, O
and O
when O
Beryl B-PERSON
suggested O
having O
a O
second B-CARDINAL
party O
, O
the B-TIME
following I-TIME
week I-TIME
, O
he O
poured O
cold O
water O
on O
the O
project O
. O

Everyone O
, O
he O
declared O
, O
had O
had O
a O
thoroughly O
good O
time O
, O
and O
it O
would O
take O
them O
nearly O
to O
next B-TIME
week I-TIME
to O
settle O
down O
again O
. O

Meanwhile O
Hubert B-PERSON
would O
have O
betaken O
himself O
and O
his O
well- O
earned O
gratuity O
to O
his O
native O
village O
at O
the O
north O
of O
the O
island O
. O

With O
an O
air O
of O
resignation O
he O
sent O
Judy B-PERSON
, O
his O
Boxer O
, O
to O
the O
back O
, O
and O
made O
room O
for O
her O
beside O
him O
. O

" O
Is O
that O
all O
you O
want O
to O
do O
? O

" O
he O
asked O
, O
letting O
in O
the O
clutch O
. O

" O
No O
; O
I O
want O
to O
make O
you O
understand O
just O
what O
happened O
about O
this O
Balicou B-LOCATION
trip O
, O
" O
she O
returned O
coldly O
. O

" O
I O
'm O
a O
little O
tired O
of O
being O
treated O
like O
an O
ineffective O
imbecile O
. O

" O
" O
And O
I O
'm O
heartily O
sick O
of O
being O
constantly O
called O
to O
account O
for O
my O
manners O
, O
" O
he O
retorted O
. O

" O
What O
have O
I O
done O
wrong O
now O
? O

I O
cover O
up O
for O
you O
the O
best O
way O
I O
can O
by O
getting O
hold O
of O
Jack B-PERSON
to O
make O
the O
presentation O
, O
I O
run O
the O
damned O
party O
to O
the O
best O
of O
my O
ability O
- O
saying O
the O
sugary O
things O
you O
ought O
to O
have O
been O
there O
to O
say O
- O
and O
all O
you O
can O
do O
is O
to O
find O
fault O
. O

" O
" O
It O
's O
your O
superior O
attitude O
that O
riles O
me O
. O

" O
Beryl B-PERSON
was O
scarlet O
with O
annoyance O
. O

" O
How O
I O
happened O
to O
be O
marooned O
at O
Balicou B-LOCATION
doesn't O
interest O
you O
in O
the O
faintest O
degree O
. O

You O
look O
as O
though O
it O
was O
only O
what O
you O
expected O
of O
me O
, O
as O
though O
I O
didn't O
care O
a O
hoot O
about O
letting O
Hubert B-PERSON
and O
his O
pals O
down O
. O

" O
" O
As O
your O
employee O
it O
's O
not O
my O
business O
to O
understand O
all O
the O
whys O
and O

of O
your O
actions O
, O
" O
he O
said O
stiffly O
. O

" O
Still O
less O
to O
criticise O
you O
. O

" O
" O
Oh O
, O
drop O
that O
nonsense O
, O
Piers B-PERSON
! O

" O
she O
exclaimed O
, O
with O
mounting O
exasperation O
. O

" O
Very O
well O
! O

" O
He O
brought O
the O
jeep O
to O
a O
standstill O
in O
a O
rough O
path O
fringed O
and O
shaded O
by O
citrus O
trees O
. O

" O
If O
you O
want O
my O
true O
opinion O
I O
'll O
give O
it O
. O

You O
made O
some O
sort O
of O
a O
protest O
to O
Graybury B-ORGANIZATION
. O

I O
'll O
give O
you O
credit O
for O
that O
. O

But O
you O
didn't O
press O
the O
matter O
because O
, O
very O
naturally O
, O
you O
were O
thoroughly O
enjoying O
Forrest's B-PERSON
company O
in O
idyllic O

. O

" O
" O
How O
dare O
you O
say O
such O
a O
thing O
? O

" O
she O
blazed O
. O

" O
For O

a O

of O

, O
" O
was O
his O
equally O
indignant O
rejoinder O
. O

" O
You O
talk O
as O
though O
we O
were O
alone O
on O
Balicou B-LOCATION
! O

" O
She O
avoided O
his O
gaze O
, O
and O
tried O
to O
ignore O
that O
last O
impertinent O
remark O
. O

" O
With O
four B-CARDINAL
other O
people O
- O
" O
" O
Whom O
you O
never O
once O
managed O
to O
circumvent O

" O
The O

" O
With O
all O

She O
met O
his O

Their O
air O
of O
smiling O

showed O
them O
to O

their O
friendly O

to O

the O

, O
made O
her O
send O
a O
complacent O
glance O
in O
Piers' B-PERSON
direction O
. O

What O
a O
fuss-box O
the O
man O
was O
, O
she O
thought O
impatiently O
, O
trying O
to O
worry O
her O
into O
the O
belief O
that O
her O
failure O
to O
appear O
at O
a O

on O
the O

was O
a O
major O
error O
: O
And O

she O
received O
a O
jolt O

standing O

in O

stretched O
in O
a O

told O
her O
in O

half B-CARDINAL

Such O

the O
life O

John's B-PERSON

had O
been O
a O
naval O
officer O
of O
the O
old O

some O
of O
his O
rigid O
ideas O
had O
been O
passed O
on O
to O
the O
second B-CARDINAL
generation O
. O

One B-CARDINAL
of O
these O
was O
that O
an O

join O
a O

on O
taking O
up O
a O

, O
at O
nine B-TIME

the O

would O

" O
" O
The O

" O
Supposing O

removed O

X-rayed O

that O
it O

" O
said O
John B-PERSON

" O
Munyard B-PERSON
didn't O
tell O
me O
that O

But O
I O
must O
confess O
I O

relieved O

But O
it O
still O
doesn't O
do O
away O
with O
the O
possibility O
of O
faulty O
design O

" O
He O
held O
out O
his O
hand O
. O

" O
Maybe O
I O
will O
take O
a O
trip O
with O
you O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
these O
days O

he O
said O

I O
'll O
tell O

me O
a O
ring O

knock O
twice O

ask O

what O
? O

" O
" O
I O
don't O
know O
when O
that O

said O
John B-PERSON

" O
I O
shall O
be O
busy O
for O
a O
while O
, O
cleaning O
up O
after O
Master O
bloody O
Munyard B-PERSON

" O
THERE O
were O
six B-CARDINAL
submarines O
, O
lying O
in O
pairs O
alongside O
the O
jetty O
at O
Fort B-LOCATION
Blockhouse I-LOCATION
. O

Black O
and O
grimly O
businesslike O
they O
both O
looked O
and O
sounded O
, O
for O
all O
of O
them O
were O
rumbling O
as O
they O
charged O
their O
electric O
batteries O
. O

A O
light O
wind O
wafted O
the O
smoke O
of O
diesel O
exhaust O
in O
through O
the O
open O
windows O
of O
the O
Captain's O
house O
. O

It O
pervaded O
every O
room O
but O
neither O
Harry B-PERSON
nor O
Madeleine B-PERSON
Turton I-PERSON
noticed O
its O
existence O
as O
they O
sat O
in O
silence O
over O
a O
substantial O
breakfast O
. O

Although O
usually O
a O
very O
talkative O
lady O
Madeleine B-PERSON
respected O
her O
husband's O
silences O
, O
for O
she O
knew O
they O
betokened O
a O
worry O
of O
some O
sort O
. O

There O
had O
been O
many O
such O
breakfasts O
lately O
since O
the O
affair O
of O
Parsifal B-PERSON
. O

Harry B-PERSON
had O
lost O
a O
good O
deal O
of O
weight O
. O

His O
normal O
placid O
and O
steady-going O
manner O
remained O
, O
but O
she O
could O
see O
that O
it O
no O
longer O
came O
naturally O
. O

It O
is O
the O
common O
lot O
of O
all O
Squadron O
Senior O
Officers O
to O
experience O
such O
catastrophes O
as O
the O
loss O
of O
a O
submarine O
, O
though O
in O
peace O
time O
these O
happenings O
are O
few O
and O
far O
between O
. O

This O
is O
the O
testing O
time O
for O
all O
. O

The O
affair O
blows O
up O
into O
a O
national O
disaster O
and O
then O
when O
it O
is O
all O
over O
life O
must O
continue O
as O
before O
. O

During O
this O
period O
the O
Captain O
must O
present O
an O
unruffled O
appearance O
and O
carry O
on O
as O
if O
nothing O
unusual O
has O
happened O
. O

Harry B-PERSON
Turton I-PERSON
had O
written O
letters O
to O
the O
bereaved O
, O
had O
visited O
many O
in O
the O
locality O

had O
been O
interviewed O
by O
the O
Press O
, O
had O
driven O
his O
surviving O
submarines O
a O
good O
deal O
harder O
than O
usual O
and O
in O
fact O
had O
applied O
all O
the O
usual O
specifics O
suitable O
for O
such O
occasions O
. O

Mr. O
Copthorne B-PERSON
knew O
a O
way O
round O
by O
the O
side O
of O
the O
church O
where O
there O
was O
a O
small O
open O
outbuilding O
where O
the O
grave O
digger O
kept O
his O
spades O
and O
forks O
and O
tidying O
up O
implements O
. O

It O
might O
be O
open O

It O
was O

He O
entered O
, O
and O
seated O
himself O
in O
a O
huddle O
upon O
an O
upturned O
wheelbarrow O
. O

His O
curious O
headgear O
fell O
off O
. O

Strange O
things O
were O
going O
on O
in O
his O
bewildered O
brain O
. O

When O
a O
man O
was O
drowning O
and O
towards O
his O
last O
gasp O
it O
was O
scientifically O
supposed O
his O
whole O

up O

him O
in O
some O
cinematic O
kind O
of O
sequence O

" O
Yes O

I O
travelled O
down O
from O
London B-LOCATION

the O

the O

a O

" O
There O
were O

quickly O
through O

" O
The O

The O

brought O
Gavin's B-PERSON

out O
to O
the O

. O

" O
Just O
a O

, O

" O
Gavin B-PERSON
pressed O
her O

smiled O

" O
I O

up O

the O

" O
Gay B-PERSON
went O
out O
to O
the O
waiting O
taxi O
, O
and O
then O
found O
that O
in O
the O
excitement O
of O
meeting O
Gavin B-PERSON
she O
had O
left O
her O
sun- O
glasses O
on O
the O

She O
went O
quickly O
back O
to O
fetch O
them O
. O

Gavin B-PERSON
and O
the O
girl O
who O
had O
got O
off O
the O

with O
him O
were O
talking O
. O

He O
was O
writing O
something O
in O
his O
pocket-book O
, O
with O
a O
sick O
feeling O
of O
despair O
Gay B-PERSON
knew O
that O
of O

Gay B-PERSON
, O
sitting O
opposite O
Gavin B-PERSON
on O
the O
terrace O
could O
hardly O
believe O
that O
she O
was O
the O

miserable O
, O
shy O
, O
who O
had O
sat O
at O
the O
little O
table O
for O
the O
first B-CARDINAL
time O
a B-TIME
few I-TIME
days I-TIME
ago I-TIME
. O

Gavin B-PERSON
raised O
his O
glass O
to O
her O
and O
smiled O
and O
Gay's B-PERSON
heart O
turned O
over O
. O

" O
I O
'd O
like O
to O
do O
that O
. O

" O
Gavin B-PERSON
drained O
his O
glass O

refilled O
it O

" O
And O
then O
we O
'll O
go O
for O
a O
stroll O
along O

A O
moon O

He O
gestured O
towards O
the O
bay O
where O
the O
full O
moon O
was O
just O
rising O
over O
the O
rocks O
, O
then O
laid O
his O
hand O
on O
hers O
. O

Gay B-PERSON
smiled O
at O
him O
again O
, O
happy O
beyond O
belief O
, O
knowing O
that O
now O
Gavin B-PERSON
was O
in O
love O

her O
only O

remembering O
for O

seen O
him O
giving O
Elaine B-PERSON

As O
he O
swung O
her O
on O

through O

Gay B-PERSON
closed O
her O

make O
love O

French B-NORP

second B-CARDINAL
best O
. O

The O
others O
came O
back O
to O
the O
table O
, O
all O
of O
them O
making O
a O
fuss O
of O
her O
and O
at O
once O
she O
felt O
happier O
. O

Gay B-PERSON
loved O
them O
for O
their O
warm O
sympathy O
, O
knowing O
that O
they O
were O
real O
friends O
, O
even O
if O
they O
were O
new O
ones O
. O

" O
That O
is O
a O
pretty O
dress O
, O
" O
Lilyan B-PERSON
commented O
, O
obviously O
sensing O
Gay's B-PERSON
distress O
and O
in O
a O
way O
that O
Doc B-PERSON
, O
as O
a O
man O
, O
could O
not O
understand O
, O
knowing O
that O
Gay B-PERSON
was O
as O
much O
ashamed O
for O
Gavin B-PERSON
at O
the O
way O
he O
was O
behaving O
as O
she O
was O
hurt O
for O
herself O
. O

Diana B-PERSON
Wills I-PERSON
often O
sat O
on O
the O
brand O
new O
seat O
outside O
the O
hospital O
gates O
and O
thought O
vagrant O
thoughts O
. O

At O
one B-CARDINAL
time O
she O
had O
watched O
the O
workmen O
constructing O
the O
roundabout O
, O
which O
was O
to O
put O
St. B-ORGANIZATION
John's I-ORGANIZATION
Casualty I-ORGANIZATION
Department I-ORGANIZATION
out O
of O
operation O
- O
in O
theory O
, O
at O
least O
. O

She O
would O
think O
of O
her- O
self O
as O
a O
stranger O
in O
these O
parts O
studying O
these O
cross-roads O
. O

Which O
one O
to O
take O
? O

" O
There O
are O
all O
sorts O
of O
wonder- O
ful O
jobs O
in O
London B-LOCATION
and O
I O
could O
take O
my O
pick O
, O
whereas O
in O
Yarmouth B-LOCATION
one O
has O
to O
know O
something O
about O
fishing O
and O
in O
Liverpool B-LOCATION
they O
'd O
want O
sea-farers O
. O

I O
don't O
think O
I O
'd O
go O
to O
Edinburgh B-LOCATION
un- O
less O
I O
was O
a O
Scot B-NORP
and O
wanting O
to O
get O
home O
, O
or O
perhaps O
a O
student O
studying O
to O
be O
a O
doctor O
, O
and O
I O
already O
know O
all O
about O
that O
. O

" O
She O
was O
engaged O
to O
Nigel B-PERSON
, O
had O
been O
for O
two B-TIME
years I-TIME
. O

Sometimes O
they O
talked O
on O
the O
theme O
of O
" O
when O
we O
get O
married O
" O
, O
and O
then O
all O
was O
wonderful O
, O
and O
perhaps O
it O
had O
only O
been O
a O
slip O
of O
the O
tongue O
when O
Nigel B-PERSON
had O
said O
, O
only O
last B-TIME
evening I-TIME
, O
" O
If O
we O
get O
married O
, O
old O
girl O
, O
you O
'll O
have O
to O
stop O
that O
lark O
, O
I O
can O
tell O
you O
! O

" O
Now O
Nigel B-PERSON
had O
every O
right O
to O
go O
where O
he O
liked O
during O
his O
off-duty O
periods O
when O
she O
was O
not O
free O
; O
this O
much O
they O
had O
conceded O
one O
to O
the O
other O
. O

They O
rarely O
found O
they O
were O
off O
duty O
together O
, O
and O
the O
situation O
would O
have O
been O
intolerable O
had O
there O
not O
been O
some O
give O
and O
take O
about O
their O
relationship O
. O

So O
when O
Nigel B-PERSON
had O
told O
her O
about O
taking O
Luke's B-PERSON
evening B-TIME
surgery O
she O
had O
said O
, O
" O
Bless O
you O
! O

I O
hope O
Luke B-PERSON
is O
suitably O
grateful O
, O
darling O
. O

" O
" O
Oh O
, O
well O
, O
" O
he O
shrugged O
diffidently O
, O
" O
I O
like O
the O
work O
. O

One O
gets O
plenty O
of O
variety O
and O
it O
's O
a O
change O
. O

" O
Nigel B-PERSON
was O
the O
hospital's O
Junior O
Medical O
Officer O
. O

" O
You O
won't O
be O
free O
about B-CARDINAL
nine I-CARDINAL
, O
I O
suppose O
, O
to O
meet O
me O
for O
supper O
somewhere O
? O

" O
she O
had O
asked O
hopefully O
. O

" O
Hardly O
likely O
, O
my O
sweet O
. O

Luke's B-PERSON
surgery O
goes O
on O
for O
hours B-TIME
. O

If O
they O
get O
in O
before O
eight-thirty B-CARDINAL
, O
even O
though O
they O
're O
standing O
on O
one O
another's O
toes O
, O
I O
've O
got O
to O
see O
'em O
. O

If O
I O
am O
free O
, O
though O
, O
I O
'll O
give O
you O
a O
ring O
, O
O.K. O
? O

" O
O.K. O
, O
" O
she O
had O
replied O
readily O
. O

So O
how O
could O
Nigel B-PERSON
have O
been O
at O
the O
Load B-LOCATION
of I-LOCATION
Trouble I-LOCATION
roadhouse O
, O
dancing O
with O
a O
blonde O
at O
eight-thirty B-TIME
that I-TIME
very I-TIME
evening I-TIME
? O

" O
No O
, O
" O
she O
told O
Phil B-PERSON
Gubbins I-PERSON
, O
a O
junior O
houseman O
, O
" O
it O
wasn't O
Nigel B-PERSON
you O
saw O
, O
my O
lad O
. O

" O
" O
It O
was O
Nigel's B-PERSON
car O
, O
anyway O
. O

NUF O
121 B-CARDINAL
. O

" O
" O
He O
probably O
loaned O
his O
car O
to O
somebody O
, O
Phil B-PERSON
. O

He O
's O
always O
doing O
that O
. O

" O
Young O
Gubbins B-PERSON
shrugged O
. O

" O
I O
didn't O
see O
his O
face O
, O
Di B-PERSON
, O
but O
it O
certainly O
looked O
like O
Nigel B-PERSON
from O
the O
back O
. O

D.j. O
and O
all O
. O

Of O
course O
such O
as O
I O
couldn't O
afford O
to O
go O
into O
the O
Load B-LOCATION
of I-LOCATION
Trouble I-LOCATION
. O

" O
But O
after O
that O
slight O
slip O
of O
the O
tongue O
on O
Nigel's B-PERSON
part O
she O
had O
realised O
it O
was O
important O
enough O
for O
her O
to O
have O
remembered O
, O
and O
it O
was O
as O
though O
a O
red O
mist O
veiled O
her O
usually O
clear O
sight O
and O
made O
her O
think O
there O
was O
an O
abyss O
immediately O
ahead O
. O

" O
Nigel B-PERSON
, O
" O
she O
had O
besought O
him O
, O
" O
you O
know O
that B-TIME
evening I-TIME
you O
took O
Luke B-PERSON
Parson's I-PERSON
surgery O
and O
there O
was O
a O
woman O
with O
a O
cyst O
on O
her O
ear O
... O
? O

" O
" O
5Ye-es O
? O

" O
he O
lowered O
his O
eyes O
and O
kissed O
her O
on O
the O
mouth O
, O
an O
act O
of O
devotion O
he O
didn't O
over-indulge O
. O

" O
What O
about O
it O
, O
my O
sweet O
? O

" O
" O
Well O
, O
" O
she O
laughed O
suddenly O
in O
an O
upsurging O
of O
relief O
, O
" O
that O
stupid O
Gubbins B-PERSON
boy O
thought O
he O
saw O
you O
at O
the O
Load B-LOCATION
of I-LOCATION
Trouble I-LOCATION
. O

With O
a O
blonde O
, O
too O
. O

Imagine O
! O

" O
Nigel B-PERSON
was O
frowning O
. O

He O
looked O
distinguished O
when O
he O
frowned O
; O
boyishly O
handsome O
at O
other O
times O
. O

" O
Gubbins B-PERSON
? O

Gubbins B-PERSON
? O

" O
he O
fretted O
. O

" O
Who O
's O
he O
? O

" O
Though O
Diana B-PERSON
knew O
the O
name O
of O
every O
member O
of O
the O
staff O
, O
distinguished O
or O
not O
, O
Nigel B-PERSON
often O
had O
to O
think O
hard O
to O
sort O
them O
out O
. O

" O
He O
's O
the O
carrotty O
lad O
, O
isn't O
he O
? O

" O
he O
now O
demanded O
. O

" O
What O
was O
he O
doing O
at O
the O
Load B-LOCATION
of I-LOCATION
Trouble I-LOCATION
? O

" O
I O
'm O
going O
with O
a O
shooting O
party O
. O

What O
else O
can O
I O
do O
at O
this O
time O
of O
year O
? O

I O
can't O
ask O
you O
up O
because O
it O
's O
a O
strictly O
stag O
affair O
. O

" O
" O
I O
know O
. O

I O
didn't O
expect O
... O
" O
" O
Well O
, O
don't O
keep O
hinting O
, O
then O
. O

You O
wish O
you O
could O
come O
with O
me O
; O
you O
hope O
I O
'll O
miss O
you O
; O
you O
can't O
imagine O
the O
hospital O
without O
me O
for O
three B-TIME
weeks I-TIME
, O
etcetera O
, O
etcetera O
! O

" O
Her O
figure O
was O
small O
and O
exquisite O
, O
like O
a O
schoolgirl's O
still O
, O
and O
he O
admired O
her O
legs O
, O
which O
the O
male O
sex O
were O
inclined O
to O
regard O
first B-CARDINAL
. O

" O
I O
would O
mind O
if O
you O
didn't O
" O
he O
told O
her O
grimly O
, O
and O
tugged O
her O
fiercely O
into O
his O
arms O
. O

" O
You O
're O
right O
, O
pet O
. O

I O
do O
need O
this O
leave O
. O

I O
'm O
bad-tempered O
and O
broody O
and O
going O
out O
with O
brash O
blondes O
. O

I O
don't O
deserve O
you O
. O

" O
" O
Darling O
! O

" O
her O
voiced O
caressed O
him O
. O

" O
Moments O
like O
this O
make O
all O
the O
waiting O
worth O
while O
. O

When O
we O
're O
married O
we O
won't O
have O
these O
explosions O
of O
emotion O
, O
will O
we O
? O

" O
" O
No O
, O
" O
he O
eyed O
her O
strangely O
. O

" O
I O
wish O
we O
were O
married O
, O
Di B-PERSON
. O

Like O
a O
patient O
wishes O
his O
operation O
was O
over O
. O

" O
Again O
her O
laughter O
trilled O
. O

" O
Marriage O
isn't O
as O
bad O
as O
an O
operation O
, O
Nigel B-PERSON
! O

" O
" O
Isn't O
it O
? O

" O
he O
rose O
and O
smoothed O
himself O
down O
. O

" O
Ask O
any O
bridegroom-to-be O
. O

Anyhow O
, O
that O
particular O
problem O
isn't O
looming O
at O
the O
moment O
, O
thank O
God O

" O
Problem O
... O
? O

looming O
... O
? O

" O
Are O
we O
discussing O
a O
marriage O
or O
a O
burial O
? O

" O
she O
asked O
, O
hardly O
believing O
he O
could O
be O
serious O
. O

" O
Surely O
marrying O
me O
isn't O
going O
to O
be O
all O
that O
bad O
? O

If O
it O
is O
- O
" O
she O
laughed O
uncertainly O
- O
" O
you O
can O
have O
your O
ring O
back O
. O

" O
She O
loosened O
the O
half-hoop B-CARDINAL
of O
diamonds O
on O
her O
left O
hand O
third B-CARDINAL
finger O
and O
held O
it O
out O
to O
him O
, O
still O
playfully O
. O

Without O
a O
glimmer O
of O
amusement O
in O
his O
own O
eyes O
, O
however O
, O
he O
took O
it O
, O
looking O
moodily O
beyond O
her O
. O

" O
Perhaps O
it O
's O
as O
well O
if O
you O
don't O
wear O
it O
for O
a O
bit O
, O
Di B-PERSON
, O
" O
he O
told O
her O
. O

" O
But O
I O
want O
it O
! O

" O
she O
protested O
. O

" O
It O
's O
my O
ring O
. O

" O
" O
You O
just O
gave O
it O
back O
to O
me O
. O

" O
" O
I O
didn't O
! O

I O
was O
joking O
. O

You O
know O
I O
was O
joking O
, O
Nigel B-PERSON
. O

" O
" O
You O
shouldn't O
joke O
about O
serious O
things O
like O
engagements O
. O

" O
" O
Don't O
be O
such O
a O
baby O
! O

" O
They O
were O
going O
to O
have O
an O
open O
quarrel O
any O
minute O
, O
and O
she O
knew O
it O
. O

Almost O
in O
desperation O
she O
appealed O
, O
" O
Will O
you O
meet O
me O
at O
the O
gate O
, O
four B-TIME
o'clock I-TIME
tomorrow I-TIME
? O

" O
" O
Why O
? O

" O
he O
enquired O
, O
combing O
his O
thick O
, O
tawny O
hair O
. O

" O
To O
bring O
me O
up O
for O
tea O
, O
of O
course O
. O

I O
just O
thought O
. O

" O
" O
I O
'll O
see O
, O
" O
he O
told O
her O
, O
and O
suddenly O
seized O
her O
in O
an O
embrace O
which O
really O
hurt O
. O

" O
Without O
your O
ring O
it O
's O
just O
like O
kissing O
somebody O
else's O
girl O
, O
" O
he O
decided O
wickedly O
, O
and O
kissed O
her O
again O
, O
somewhat O
startled O
to O
receive O
a O
sharp O
slap O
for O
his O
pains O
. O

" O
If O
I O
were O
somebody O
else's O
girl O
that O
's O
what O
you O
'd O
get O
, O
" O
she O
flashed O
at O
him O
, O
and O
so O
had O
left O
him O
, O
on O
her O
dignity O
and O
not O
seeing O
the O
look O
of O
admiration O
and O
revelation O
which O
had O
followed O
her O
slim O
young O
figure O
out O
of O
his O
sight O
. O

" O
Mine O
, O
" O
Nigel B-PERSON
Lester I-PERSON
had O
decided O
with O
a O
sigh O
of O
satisfaction O
, O
and O
then O
regarded O
the O
ring O
which O
he O
retrieved O
from O
his O
pocket O
. O

" O
At O
a O
price O
, O
" O
he O
concluded O
, O
with O
some O
bitterness O
. O

Thus O
had O
they O
parted O
the O
previous B-TIME
evening I-TIME
and O
now O
Diana B-PERSON
was O
trailing O
up O
the O
gravelled O
drive O
to O
the O
hospital O
alone O
. O

Of O
course O
one O
couldn't O
say O
for O
certain O
when O
a O

would O
be O

the O

tea O
was O
served O
from O
four B-CARDINAL
until O
five-thirty B-CARDINAL
in O
the O
residents' O
common- O

, O
which O
proved O
the O
elasticity O
of O
medical O
commitments O
. O

Something O
had O
cropped O
up O
which O
required O
Nigel's B-PERSON
attention O
, O
she O
was O
convinced O
, O
or O
he O
would O
have O
granted O
her O
small O
request O
to O
be O

at O
the O

, O

had O
long O
sensed O

in O
the O

drawn O
between O
ordinary O
wage-earners O

those O
self-employed O

By O
the O

any O

Cecil B-PERSON
had O
so O

avoided O

He O
read O
the O

sorry O

frowned O
at O
the O
provisions O
of O
Schedule O

taxation O
which O
not O
only O
allowed O
her O
to O
claim O
relief O
on O
the O
most O
unlikely O
purchases O
, O
but O
also O
postponed O
demanding O
the O
tax O
until O
her B-TIME
financial I-TIME
year I-TIME
was O
ended O
, O
audited O
and O
agreed O
by O
the O

did O
take O
several B-TIME
years I-TIME

At O
one B-CARDINAL
point O
the O
astute O

had O
claimed O

relief O
on O
the O
pur- O

, O
it O
seemed O

were O
necessary O
to O
fur- O

Alternatively O
, O
it O
was O
reported O

she O
tearfully O

alone O

He O
fumed O
as O
he O
recol- O
lected O
the O
long O
correspondence O
he O
had O
had O
with O
the O
Inland B-ORGANIZATION

in O
an O
effort O
to O
obtain O
tax O

for O
a O
jacket O
used O
solely O
in O
the O
office O
. O

' O
If O
the O
jacket O
is O
a O

of O
your O
employment O
, O
' O
the O
Inspector O
had O
written O
, O
' O
it O

' O
' O
It O

I O
wasn't O
sitting O
there O
. O

' O
She O
blinked O
disdainfully O
at O
him O
and O
stepped O
out O
. O

It O
was O
a O
new O
briefcase O
, O
and O
as O
the O
train O
jogged O
along O
the O
shiny O
clasp O
twinkled O
invitingly O
at O
Cecil B-PERSON
. O

He O
wondered O
what O
it O
contained O
. O

Probably O
the O
remains O
of O
someone's O
lunch O
or O
a O
few O
secret O
files O
. O

He O
smiled O
at O
his O
own O
joke O
. O

It O
was O
locked O
. O

Eager O
fingers O
felt O
bulky O
contents O
and O
when O
he O
shook O
the O
case O
there O
was O
a O
rustling O
thud O
of O
wads O
of O
paper O
. O

' O
Cor O
! O

' O
he O
muttered O
aloud O
, O
' O
there O
's O
five B-CARDINAL
thousand I-CARDINAL
at O
least O
. O

' O
He O
felt O
in O
his O
jacket O
pocket O
and O
pulled O
out O
a O
key O
ring O
. O

In O
succession O
he O
tried O
his O
own O
briefcase O
key O
, O
a O
suitcase O
key O
and O
a O
device O
designed O
to O
lock O
typewriters O
. O

Cecil B-PERSON
searched O
in O
his O
pockets O
once O
more O
and O
came O
up O
with O
two B-CARDINAL
paper-clips O
. O

After O
a B-TIME
few I-TIME
seconds I-TIME
of O
twisting O
, O
he O
roughly O
thrust O
a O
bent O
wire O
loop O
into O
the O
lock O
and O
waggled O
it O
around O
vigorously O
. O

There O
was O
a O
click O
and O
the O
briefcase O
opened O
. O

Cecil B-PERSON
thrust O
an O
eager O
hand O
inside O
, O
his O
fingers O
groping O
after O
wads O
of O
five B-CARDINAL
pound O
notes O
. O

They O
closed O
on O
a O
single O
bundle O
and O
, O
fumbling O
with O
nervous O
excitement O
, O
he O
pulled O
it O
out O
. O

His O
eye O
rested O
on O
a O
wad O
of O
stiff O
white O
paper O
printed O
on O
one B-CARDINAL
side O
. O

' O
Old O
fashioned O
fivers O
! O

' O
he O
muttered O
again O
, O
and O
tried O
to O
recall O
if O
they O
were O
still O
legal O
tender O
. O

Surely O
the O
Govr. O
and O
Compa. O
of O
the O
Bank B-ORGANIZATION
of I-ORGANIZATION
England I-ORGANIZATION
would O
never O
break O
their O
promise O
to O
pay O
on O
rude O
demand O
, O
let O
alone O
on O
polite O
request O
. O

Cecil B-PERSON
frowned O
in O
disappointment O
as O
he O
focussed O
upon O
the O
printing O
to O
find O
no O
Govr. O
, O
no O
Compa. O
, O
in O
fact O
no O
five B-CARDINAL
pound O
notes O
at O
all O
. O

He O
was O
holding O
a O
paper O
booklet O
, O
the O
top O
sheet O
of O
which O
bore O
, O
in O
large O
Baskerville O
type O
, O
the O
words O

. O

He O
ruffled O
the O
sheets O
irritably O
and O
glowered O
at O
his O
own O
breach O
of O
social O
morality O
. O

He O
climbed O
the O
stairs O
, O
eager O
to O
unload O
the O
guilt-symbol O
upon O
the O
ticket-collector O
and O
then O
to O
emerge O
carrying O
his O
shame O
unseen O
, O
but O
burning O
, O
into O
the O
night B-TIME
. O

He O
reached O
the O
barrier O
and O
fumbled O
for O
his O
contract O
before O
thrusting O
the O
briefcase O
at O
the O
ticket-collector O
with O
the O
firm O
intention O
of O
playing O
the O
dutiful O
citizen O
retrieving O

Sentence O
Database O
Before O
he O
could O
open O
his O
mouth O
, O
the O

stretched O
out O
a O
hand O
. O

' O
Watch O

The O

pressed O
the O

home O
with O
a O

Cecil B-PERSON
, O
irretrievably O
laden O
with O
both O
briefcase O
and O
conscience O
, O
stumbled O
away O
into O
the O
darkness O
. O

' O

He O
nodded O
irritably O
and O
, O
turning O
his O
back O
to O
her O
, O
contrived O
to O
slide O
the O

between O

Cecil B-PERSON
gritted O
his O
teeth O
and O
glowered O
at O
the O
inequity O
of O
Miss O
Cheesecake B-PERSON
well-nigh O
bathing O
in O
tax-free O
champagne O
whilst O
he O
had O
to O
go O
easy O
on O
the O

. O

' O
What O
is O
it O
, O
Cecil B-PERSON
? O

Don't O
you O

' O
his O

asked O
solicitously O

Cecil B-PERSON

towards O
the O
dining O

' O
I O

sure O

must O
be O

' O
Cecil B-PERSON
wriggled O
irritably O
under O
the O
misplaced O
management O
of O
a O
mother O
who O
had O
failed O
to O
realise O
that O
a O
son O
who O
is O
nearly O
bald O
is O
no O
longer O
a O
baby O
. O

He O
started O
to O
climb O
the O
stairs O
, O
stamping O
with O
unnecessary O
vigour O
upon O
the O
treads O
. O

' O
And O
don't O
wipe O
the O

off O

' O
There O
was O
a O
tinkle O
and O
a O
thud O
from O
beside O
the O
coat O

. O

Cecil's B-PERSON
mother O
turned O
around O
in O
time O
to O
see O
the O
briefcase O
collapse O
against O
the O
brass O
umbrella O

' O
Well O
now O

' O
She O
hurried O
towards O
it O

up O

' O
Cecil B-PERSON
halted O
in O
mid-step O

clenched O
his O
fists O

' O
So O
that O

what O

hissed O
without O

round O

pointed O
to O
the O

' O
So O
that O

why O

down O

Olner I-PERSON
In O
spite O
of O
all O
the O
transferred O
maternity O
she O
was O
endowed O
with O
by O
her O
patients O
, O
poor O
Serena B-PERSON
was O
an O
infant-in-arms O
as O
a O
buyer O
of O
property O
. O

No O
, O
not O
even O
an O
infant-in-arms O
but O
a O
new-born O
babe O
, O
a O
premature O
piece O
of O
frailty O
in O
an O
oxygen- O
tent O
of O
utter O
innocence O
. O

The O
complexity O
of O
that O
innocence O
was O
colossal O
. O

It O
had O
layer O
after O
layer O
of O
illusion O
to O
be O
peeled O
off O
and O
replaced O
with O
sad O
knowledgeability O
. O

It O
was O
a O
nakedness O
of O
nai"vety O
to O
be O
clothed O
leaf O
by O
leaf O
with O
the O
disappointment O
of O
experience O
. O

Her O
first B-CARDINAL
illusion O
consisted O
in O
the O
belief O
that O
all O
she O
need O
do O
was O
to O
go O
to O
an O
agent O
, O
visit O
half B-CARDINAL
a I-CARDINAL
dozen I-CARDINAL
houses O
in O
one B-TIME
day I-TIME
, O
choose O
one B-CARDINAL
, O
make O
an O
offer O
, O
put O
it O
in O
the O
hands O
of O
a O
lawyer O
and O
go O
away O
on O
her O
holiday O
while O
the O
whole O
transaction O
was O
put O
through O
. O

Fortunately O
, O
however O
, O
the O
fashion O
for O
Victorian B-NORP
architecture O
which O
Mr. O
John B-PERSON
Betjeman I-PERSON
had O
started O
several B-TIME
decades I-TIME
before O
had O
caught O
on O
at O
last O
and O
therefore O
saved O
the O
situation O
for O
the O
affluent O
middle-class O
, O
who O
now O
had O
plenty O
of O
lovely-ugly O
to O
be O
coldly O
elegant O
in O
. O

All O
this O
Serena B-PERSON
discovered O
, O
and O
more O
, O
but O
in O
stages O
. O

For O
the O
first B-CARDINAL
thing O
she O
did O
was O
to O
make O
an O
offer O
on O
a O
small O
pink O
terraced O
cottage O
, O
two B-CARDINAL
beds O
, O
two B-CARDINAL
inter-comm. O

, O
sep. O
W.C. O
small O
back O
yard O
, O
newly O
dec. O
, O
near O
shops O
and O
tube O
The O
next O
thing O
that O
Serena B-PERSON
discovered O
was O
that O
she O
could O
not O
afford O
to O
buy O
a O
house O
at O
all O
. O

And O
this O
in O
spite O
of O
having O
at O
last O
managed O
to O
save O
the O
ten B-CARDINAL
percent O
needed O
. O

Or O
so O
she O
thought O
, O
being O
then O
in O
possession O
of O
what O
seemed O
to O
her O
the O
princely O
sum O
of O
six B-CARDINAL
hund- I-CARDINAL
red I-CARDINAL
pounds O
. O

The O
lawyer O
said O
: O
" O
Of O
course O
you O
must O
count O
about B-CARDINAL
two I-CARDINAL
hundred I-CARDINAL
for O
legal O
charges O
and O

, O
maybe O
less O
, O
depending O
on O
the O
price O
of O
the O
house O
, O
and O
whether O
it O
has O
been O
regis- O
tered O

" O
" O
Not O

" O
" O
Er O
, O
yes O

You O
have O
some O
securities O

then O
? O

" O
His O
aspect O
was O
as O
dusty O
as O
his O
office O

with O
scurf O
from O
dusty O
hair O
on O
the O
dusty O
shoulders O
of O
his O
black O

down O
the O

an O
ashen O
face O
and O
yellow O
sleepy O
dust O
in O
the O
corners O
of O
his O
pale O
grey O
eyes O

His O
finger-nails O
were O
dirty O
, O
though O
he O
tried O
to O
make O
up O
for O
it O
by O
constantly O
paring O
them O
with O
the O
finger-nail O
of O
the O
opposite O
hand O

" O
Yes O

well O

. O

" O
He O
judged O
that O
she O
had O
been O
sufficiently O
dazzled O

gave O
a O
long O
raucous O
cough O

Oh O

it O
