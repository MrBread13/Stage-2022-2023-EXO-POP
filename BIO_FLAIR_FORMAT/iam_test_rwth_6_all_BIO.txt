The O
second B-CARDINAL
said O
that O
the O
problems O
which O
arise O
from O
the O
comparisons O

can O
be O
reasonably O
solved O
by O
paying O
due O
regard O
to O
the O
time O

plan O
and O
to O
the O
different O
public O
for O
which O
, O
or O
against O
which O
, O
the O
author O
wrote O
. O

The O
third B-CARDINAL
article O
excluded O
any O
allegorical O
interpretation O
of O
the O
Gospel O
. O

There O
is O
a O
whole O
group O
of O
theories O
which O
attempt O
to O
explain O
the O
problems O
of O
the O
Fourth B-CARDINAL
Gospel O
by O
explanations O
based O
on O
assumed O
textual O
dislocations O
. O

The O
present O
state O
of O
the O
Gospel O
is O
the O
result O
of O
an O
accident-prone O
history O
. O

The O
original O
was O
written O
on O
a O
roll O
, O
or O
codex O
, O
which O
fell O
into O
disorder O
or O
was O
accidentally O
damaged O
. O

An O
editor O
, O
who O
was O
not O
the O
author O
, O
made O
what O
he O
could O
of O
the O
chaos O
by O
placing O
the O
fragments O
, O
or O
sheets O
, O
or O
pages O
, O
in O
order O
. O

The O
one B-CARDINAL
real O
weakness O
of O
the O
Commentator's O
case O
is O
that O
, O
in O
common O
with O
all O
his O
colleagues O
, O
he O
has O
not O
, O
until O
now O
, O
been O
able O
to O
exhibit O
exactly O
how O
this O
enlargement O
was O
effected O
nor O
has O
he O
been O
able O
to O
explain O
the O
textual O
movements O
by O
showing O
that O
such O
changes O
are O
part O
of O
a O
simple O
and O
coherent O
plan O
. O

To O
understand O
how O
this O
is O
possible O
it O
is O
necessary O
to O
examine O
the O
text O
of O
the O
Gospel O
. O

THE O
Fourth B-CARDINAL
Gospel O
was O
almost O
certainly O
written O
in O
Greek O
. O

A O
modern O
text O
of O
the O
Gospel O
represents O
the O
work O
of O
generations O
of O
scholars O
who O
have O
compared O
the O
many O
manu- O
scripts O
of O
John B-PERSON
and O
worked O
out O
the O
version O
which O
is O
most O
likely O
to O
have O
been O
the O
original O
wording O
. O

It O
is O
not O
possible O
to O
establish O
any O
one O
text O
with O
absolute O
precision O
. O

The O
bar O
was O
the O
commonest O
marking O
, O
but O
others O
were O
also O
used O
. O

Dots O
sometimes O
served O
in O
place O
of O
the O
bar O
, O
and O
there O
are O
cases O
where O
spacing O
is O
used O
as O
it O
is O
now O
used O
to O
mark O
a O
paragraph O
ending O
. O

Frequently O
paragraphos O
markings O
were O
omitted O
. O

C. B-PERSON
H. I-PERSON
Roberts I-PERSON
is O
of O
the O
opinion O
that O
in O
the O
original O
of O
the O
Fourth B-CARDINAL
Gospel O
some O
markings O
would O
be O
used O
, O
although O
which O
, O
it O
is O
impossible O
to O
say O
. O

Professor O
E. B-PERSON
G. I-PERSON
Turner I-PERSON
is O
inclined O
to O
take O
the O
view O
that O
the O
original O
of O
the O
Gospel O
would O
be O
unmarked O
. O

The O
original O
of O
the O
Gospel O
, O
whether O
written O
on O
a O
roll O
or O
codex O
, O
whether O
paragraphed O
or O
not O
, O
would O
be O
laid O
out O
in O
columns O
. O

This O
is O
the O
invariable O
practice O
of O
ancient O
manuscripts O
. O

A O
common O
size O
of O
column O
would O
hold O
about B-CARDINAL
one I-CARDINAL
third I-CARDINAL
of O
a O
page O
of O
Souter's B-PERSON
print O
. O

The O
edge O
of O
this O
sheet O
was O
attached O
to O
a O
wooden O
dowel O
and O
the O
sheet O
wound O
round O
this O
central O
pin O
. O

The O
roll O
made O
a O
simple O
and O
serviceable O
book O
. O

It O
was O
robust O
- O
the O
number O
which O
have O
survived O
the B-TIME
centuries I-TIME
is O
ample O
evidence O
of O
this O
- O
and O
it O
was O
easily O
stored O
. O

It O
had O
two B-CARDINAL
disadvantages O
. O

It O
was O
generally O
a O
single-sided O
form O
of O
book O
, O
and O
it O
was O
not O
an O
easy O
form O
of O
book O
in O
which O
to O
find O
a O
reference O
. O

This O
last O
objection O
might O
have O
had O
some O
weight O
in O
ecclesiastical O
circles O
. O

In O
his O
Natural O
History O
, O
13 B-CARDINAL
. O

11-12 B-CARDINAL
, O
the O
elder O
Pliny B-PERSON
tells O
of O
the O
use O
of O
papyrus O
in O
roll-making O
. O

As O
Pliny B-PERSON
was O
killed O
in O
the O
eruption O
of O
Vesuvius B-LOCATION
which O
overwhelmed O
Herculaneum B-LOCATION
and O
Pompeii B-LOCATION
in O
A.D. B-TIME
79 I-TIME
, O
his O
information O
is O
contemporaneous O
with O
the O
New O
Testament O
. O

The O
other O
form O
of O
book O
was O
the O
codex O
. O

In O
this O
the O
sheets O
were O
bound O
together O
down O
one B-CARDINAL
edge O
much O
as O
they O
are O
in O
modern O
books O
. O

Against O
these O
advantages O
the O
codex O
was O
fragile O
and O
might O
be O
bulky O
. O

It O
is O
sometimes O
possible O
to O
tell O
whether O
or O
not O
a O
particular O
text O
was O
written O
on O
a O
roll O
or O
a O
codex O
. O

Rolls O
were O
prepared O
for O
writing O
, O
but O
any O
papyrus O
left O
unused O
at O
the O
end O
could O
be O
cut O
off O
. O

If O
the O
text O
was O
longer O
than O
the O
roll O
, O
a O
sheet O
could O
easily O
be O
glued O
on O
. O

The O
verso O
of O
the O
roll O
was O
blank O
, O
and O
one O
cannot O
think O
of O
an O
author O
, O
Mark B-PERSON
for O
example O
, O
sending O
out O
his O
Gospel O
lacking O
the O
ending O
, O
while O
one O
whole O
side O
of O
his O
roll O
was O
unused O
. O

The O
codex O
form O
was O
not O
so O
accommodating O
. O

Even O
in O
the O
case O
of O
the O
single-sheet O
quire O
, O
an O
extra O
sheet O
glued O
on O
might O
have O
to O
be O
gummed O
on O
over O
the O
binding O
, O
or O
the O
whole O
codex O
rebound O
. O

A O
natural O
transition O
from O
gardens O
and O
orchards O
to O
the O
vital O
question O
of O
water O
supply O
. O

The O
pools O
are O
probably O
natural O
springs O
enlarged O
to O
become O
reservoirs O
or O
cisterns O
in O
the O
rock O
. O

King O
Mesha B-PERSON
of O

of O
their O
construction O
in O
lines O

, O
23-25 B-CARDINAL
of O
the O

Stone O
, O
which O

: O
And O
I O
built O

The O
word O
Shamir O
was O
used O
as O
a O
personal O
name O
( O
Git. O
68a B-CARDINAL
) O
. O

The O
Hebrew O
word O
" O
SHAMIR O
" O
means O
guarded O
or O
preser- O
ved O
. O

Therefore O
, O
the O
real O
man O
, O
who O
regards O
himself O
as O
insignificant O
, O
as O
the O
prayer O
says O
: O
" O
What O
am O
I O
? O

A O
worm O
" O
, O
he O
is O
the O
Shamir O
and O
such O
a O
man O
fulfils O
the O
Shmah O
, O
loves O
the O
Lord O
God O
with O
all O
his O
heart O
, O
and O
with O
all O
his O
soul O
and O
with O
all O
his O
might O
and O
studies O
the O
word O
of O
God O
. O

This O
man O
is O
the O
worm O
, O
the O
creature O
that O
cuts O
and O
polishes O
Altar-Stones B-LOCATION
. O

Such O
a O
man O
is O
the O
Shamir O
that O
guards O
him- O
self O
against O
all O
the O
irrelevant O
pleasures O
. O

Such O
a O
Shamir O
possesses O
the O
real O
acid O
to O
mould O
our O
character O
, O
to O
melt O
our O
heart O
of O
stone O
. O

This O
Shamir O
helps O
us O
earthly O
creatures O
to O
build O
an O
Altar O
for O
God O
to O
come O
nearer O
to O
God O
. O

The O
action O
of O
the O
Shamir O
writes O
books O
and O
their O
books O
are O
readable O
. O

This O
Shamir O
is O
indeed O
a O
rare O
diamond O
that O
incises O
the O
hardest O
rock O
, O
the O
hardest O
facts O

And O
these O
creatures O

from O

command O
you O
this O
day O
, O
to O
love O
the O
Lord O
your O
God O
, O
and O
to O
serve O
Him O
with O
all O
your O
heart O

with O
all O
your O
soul O
. O

" O
This O
may O
seem O
very O
good O
, O
but O
there O
is O
something O
deficient O
. O

Under O
such O
conditions O
without O
putting O
your O

together O
we O
cannot O
solve O
the O
further O
summons O
of O

the O

Hence O
says O
Rabbi O
Simeon B-PERSON
ben I-PERSON
Jochai I-PERSON
( O
Tanis B-LOCATION
6a B-CARDINAL
) O
" O
if O
Israel B-LOCATION
does O
not O
fulfil O
the O
wish O
of O
the O
Lord O
, O
failing O
to O
serve O
the O
Lord O
God O
with O
all O
their O
visionary O
power O
, O
the O
work O
will O
have O
to O
be O
done O
by O
each O
individual O
" O
. O

They O
will O
not O
work O
in O
union O
. O

If O
physical O
power O
, O
spiritual O
power O
and O
visionary O
power O
is O
not O
united O
, O
man O
will O
remain O
in O
his O
heart O
selfish O
and O
think O
only O
of O
one's O
personal O
advantage O
to O
gratify O
selfish O
aims O
, O
then O
each O
man O
will O
gather-in O
for O
himself O
only O
, O
instead O
of O
all O
to O
help O
to O
gather O
your O
corn O
, O
your O
wine O
and O
your O
oil O
. O

Freedom O
from O

cannot O
be O
fulfilled O
nor O
freedom O
from O
fear O
, O
fear O
of O
starvation O
in O
the O

Help O
will O
not O
be O
easily O
forth- O
coming O
for O
the O
people O
in O

They O
will O
think O
of O
the O

first O
( O
which O

Of O
course O
the O

will O
eat O

: O
" O
Take O
heed O
to O
yourself O
, O
that O
your O

not O
deceived O
, O
and O
1ye O
turn O
aside O

" O
, O
the O

And O
you O
serve O
Mammon O

And O
you O
cannot O
serve O

you O
worship O
self-interest O

under O
such O

" O
And O
then O
the O
Lord's O

he O
shut O
up O

" O
Therefore O

" O
The O

adds O

in O
your O

searching O

And O
the O
sequence O
in O
the O

is O
different O
than O
in O

" O
First B-CARDINAL

the O

then O
" O

" O
And O
as O
we O
have O

through O

, O
we O
need O
not O
teach O
them O
to O
the O

the O

will O
grasp O
now O
what O

them O

And O
the O
tsitsits B-NORP
had O
a O
message O
sealed O
inside O

just O
as O
there O
is O
a O
message O
sealed O

the O

we O

self-control O

( O
1 B-CARDINAL
) O
I O
will O
bring O
you O
out O
from O
under O
the O
burdens O
of O
Egypt B-LOCATION
: O
How O
was O
it O
that O
Israel B-LOCATION
was O
brought O
out O
from O
under O
the O
burdens O
of O
Egypt B-LOCATION
? O

Because O
, O
they O
kept O
the O
Passover O
and O
they O
were O
eating O
Matzos O
in O
Egypt B-LOCATION
and O
the O
" O
Feast O
of O
Matzos O
" O
was O
known O
even O
to O
Abraham B-PERSON
and O
Lot B-PERSON
. O

The B-TIME
new I-TIME
century I-TIME
opened O
with O
James B-PERSON
1 I-PERSON
ascending O
the O
throne O
. O

He O
was O
quite O
prepared O
to O
be O
tolerant O
towards O
Rome B-LOCATION
though O
the O
Gunpowder O
Plot O
spoiled O
that O
. O

The O
Puritans B-NORP
had O
high O
hopes O
, O
for O
James B-PERSON
had O
grown O
up O
in O
Presbyterian B-NORP
Scotland B-LOCATION
, O
but O
those O
hopes O
were O
dashed O
. O

True O
, O
a O
new O
Prayer O
Book O
was O
issued O
in O
1604 B-TIME
but O
the O
Puritans B-NORP
derived O
little O
comfort O
from O
it O
. O

They O
objected O
to O
the O
word O
Absolution O
. O

So O
the O
phrase O
' O
or O
the O
remission O
of O
sins O
' O
was O
added O
. O

But O
Absolution O
remained O
. O

They O
objected O
to O
the O
word O
Confirmation O
. O

So O
the O
phrase O
' O
or O
the O
laying O
on O
of O
hands O
upon O
children O
baptized O
and O
able O
to O
render O
an O
account O
of O
their O
faith O
according O
to O
the O
Catechism O
following O
' O
were O
added O
. O

But O
Confirmation O
remained O
. O

Other O
changes O
in O
the O
Book O
were O
equally O
minor O
except O
for O
the O
new O
section O
on O
the O
Sacraments O
added O
to O
the O
Catechism O
. O

This O
indicated O
how O
ephemeral O
in O
the O
Church B-ORGANIZATION
had O
been O
the O
mood O
which O
produced O
the O
Black O
Rubric O
, O
for O
it O
says O
that O
' O
the O
Body O
and O
Blood O
of O
Christ B-PERSON
, O
which O
are O
verily O
and O
indeed O
taken O
and O
received O
by O
the O
faithful O
in O
the O
Lord's O
Supper O
. O

' O
It O
could O
hardly O
be O
more O
definite O
. O

It O
was O
at O
this O
time O
, O
too O
, O
that O
King O
James B-PERSON
made O
himself O
immortal O
by O
becoming O
associated O
with O
a O
Bible O
translation O
- O
the O
Authorized O
Version O
( O
which O
was O
never O
actually O
authorized O
! O

) O
. O

In O
that O
year O
Shakespeare B-PERSON
had O
just O
turned O
forty B-TIME
and O
had O
written O
Hamlet B-PERSON
two B-TIME
years I-TIME
before I-TIME
. O

Bacon B-PERSON
was O
at O
work O
and O
Milton B-PERSON
was O
just O
learning O

James B-PERSON
was O
followed O
by O
Charles B-PERSON
, O
in O
whose O
reign O
came O
the O
Scottish B-NORP
Prayer O
Book O
in O
1637 B-TIME
. O

Significantly O
this O
made O
a O
deliberate O
return O
to O
the O
Book O
of O
1549 B-TIME
and O
became O
the O
foster O
mother O
of O
some O
of O
the O
most O
important O
Prayer O
Books O
in O
the O
Anglican B-ORGANIZATION
Communion I-ORGANIZATION
. O

Forever O
associated O
with O
Charles B-PERSON
is O
Archbishop O
Laud B-PERSON
, O
now O
so O
much O
nobler O
a O
figure O
than O
former O
historians O
led O
us O
to O
believe O
. O

Laud B-PERSON
was O
enthusiastically O
hated O
by O
Calvinists B-NORP
and O
Puritans B-NORP
, O
and O
the O
sentiment O
was O
mutual O
. O

But O
Laud B-PERSON
was O
no O
Romanizer O
. O

One B-CARDINAL
of O
his O
first B-CARDINAL
public O
acts O
was O
a O
hard-hitting O
battle O
with O
the O
Jesuit B-NORP
, O
Fisher B-PERSON
. O

But O
anyone O
who O
was O
friendly O
with O
James B-PERSON
and O
Charles B-PERSON
, O
the O
Puritans B-NORP
argued O
, O
was O
necessarily O
a O
menace O
. O

Or O
when O
he O
found O
cock-fighting O
going O
on O
in O
church O
? O

Laud B-PERSON
made O
a O
positive O
approach O
. O

He O
set O
out O
to O
increase O
a O
sense O
of O
reverence O
. O

The O
Prayer O
Book O
was O
to O
be O
respected O
and O
so O
was O
the O
office O
of O
a O
bishop O
. O

Altars O
should O
be O
altars O
and O
not O
any O
broken O
down O
, O
transportable O
table O
which O
was O
handy O
for O
the O
most O
improbable O
uses O
. O

Even O
worse O
is O
to O
laugh O
. O

Tremendous O
damage O
may O
be O
done O
to O
a O
child O
by O
laughing O
at O
what O
are O
very O
real O
fears O
. O

As O
adults O
, O
we O
know O
that O
their O
fears O
are O
groundless O
, O
indeed O
to O
us O
they O
appear O
laughable O
, O
but O
to O
a O
child O
they O
are O
very O
real O
. O

Not O
that O
I O
am O
suggesting O
that O
children O
should O
be O
molly-coddled O
- O
they O
must O
be O
made O
to O
face O
their O
fears O
, O
to O
see O
through O
them O
and O
come O
out O
on O
the O
other O
side O
as O
victors O
. O

To O
ridicule O
them O
only O
pushes O
them O
farther O
into O
themselves O
, O
so O
that O
they O
become O
unable O
to O
speak O
about O
it O
to O
anybody O
and O
the O
seeds O
of O
any O
amount O
of O
trouble O
are O
sown O
, O
the O
harvest O
of O
which O
may O
still O
be O
being O
reaped O
at O
forty B-CARDINAL
or O
fifty B-CARDINAL
. O

Far O
better O
to O
agree O
with O
a O
child O
that O
a O
particular O
situation O
is O
frightening O
, O
and O
then O
to O
face O
it O
together O
until O
the O
child O
can O
see O
how O
unnecessary O
its O
fears O
were O
. O

Because O
situations O
which O
may O
contain O
all O
the O
elements O
of O
fear O
can O
arise O
suddenly O
, O
it O
is O
a O
good O
idea O
to O
condition O
a O
child O
to O
some O
extent O
against O
it O
. O

To O
keep O
a O
child O
of O
twelve B-CARDINAL
or O
thirteen B-CARDINAL
under O
the O
impression O
that O
nothing O
nasty O
ever O
happens O
is O
not O
merely O
dishonest O
, O
it O
is O
unwise O
. O

As O
I O
shall O
suggest O
in O
a O
later O
chapter O
there O
are O
some O
situations O
which O
occur O
less O
frequently O
than O
In O
Gethsemane B-LOCATION
He O
prayed O
that O
the O
cup O
should O
pass O
from O
Him O
. O

Jesus B-PERSON
shows O
us O
the O
way O
to O
face O
life O
. O

To O
see O
all O
the O
latent O
frightening O
possibilities O
and O
yet O
by O
facing O
them O
and O
knowing O
God O
is O
with O
us O
and O
that O
, O
with O
Him O
, O
there O
is O
nothing O
that O
can O
finally O
defeat O
us O
. O

More O
than O
that O
, O
that O
God O
has O
something O
important O
to O
do O
with O
our O
lives O
and O
that O
the O
nearer O
we O
get O
to O
Him O
, O
the O
stronger O
we O
become O
. O

... O
Today B-TIME
A O
wonderful O
thought O
In O
the O
dawn O
was O
given O
... O
And O
the O
thought O
Was O
this O

secret O

, O
who O
experienced O
all O
human O
emotion O
, O
and O
whose O
sensitive O
nature O
knows O
better O
than O
we O
do O
, O
what O
it O
is O
to O
be O
really O
afraid O
, O
help O
us O
to O
know O
that O
when O
we O
face O
life O
boldly O
, O
many O
of O
the O
shadows O
are O
seen O
to O
be O
allies O
and O
not O
enemies O
and O
that O
, O
come O
what O
may O
, O
we O
are O
never O
alone O
when O
we O
are O
with O
Thee O
. O

To O
others O
, O
the O
long O
hours O
of O
the O
night B-TIME
bring O
only O
a O
disturbed O
tossing O
and O
turning O
which O
causes O
them O
to O
wake O
feeling O
worse O
than O
when O
they O
went O
to O
bed O
. O

We O
may O
begin O
to O
understand O
this O
a O
little O
better O
when O
we O
realize O
that O
tiredness O
itself O
is O
largely O
in O
the O
mind O
. O

Very O
few O
people O
, O
under O
normal O
conditions O
, O
work O
themselves O
to O
a O
standstill O
. O

The O
mind O
tires O
first B-CARDINAL
and O
conveys O
the O
impression O
of O
tiredness O
to O
the O
body O
. O

This O
can O
be O
proved O
by O
noting O
the O
effect O
of O
a O
new O
stimulus O
on O
some- O
body O
who O
feels O
thoroughly O
tired O
. O

Suppose O
a O
mother O
has O
news O
late B-TIME
at I-TIME
night I-TIME
that O
her O
child O
is O
in O
danger O
. O

She O
will O
undertake O
a O
journey O
which O
, O
an B-TIME
hour I-TIME
before O
, O
she O
would O
have O
declared O
impossible O
. O

Even O
more O
simply O
, O
test O
your O
own O
reactions O
to O
different O
situations O
. O

There O
are O
some O
which O
bring O
on O
an O
almost O
immediate O
feeling O
of O
tiredness O
- O
such O
as O
when O
your O
wife O
mentions O
the O
washing-up O
- O
while O
others O
, O
if O
they O
refer O
to O
something O
you O
like O
doing O
, O
bring O
a O
veritable O
surge O
of O
energy O
. O

Many O
a O
girl O
who O
is O
' O
too O
tired O
to O
help O
mum O
' O
will O
later O
jump O
up O
with O
no O
apparent O
tiredness O
at O
all O
when O
her O
boy O
friend O
calls O
and O
go O
for O
a O
long O
walk O
. O

They O
drag O
themselves O
around O
and O
can O
become O
a O
burden O
to O
their O
families O
and O
their O
friends O
. O

Any O
mental O
confusion O
can O
cause O
this O
and O
the O
best O
way O
is O
probably O
to O
seek O
advice O
. O

As O
we O
are O
unable O
to O
cure O
our O
own O
bodies O
if O
the O
cause O
of O
our O
pain O
is O
too O
deep O
seated O
, O
so O
we O
are O
unable O
to O
cure O
our O
own O
minds O
, O
if O
the O
trouble O
is O
a O
complicated O
one O
involving O
careful O
and O
patient O
treatment O
. O

One B-CARDINAL
of O
the O
greatest O
steps O
forward O
that O
has O
been O
made O
this B-TIME
century I-TIME
is O
the O
way O
in O
which O
illness O
of O
the O
mind O
is O
no O
longer O
feared O
or O
shunned O
, O
and O
is O
in O
fact O
no O
differently O
regarded O
than O
physical O
illness O
. O

There O
is O
, O
nevertheless O
, O
a O
great O
deal O
of O
tiredness O
which O
comes O
from O
no O
major O
complication O
but O
results O
from O
an O
inability O
to O
deal O
with O
life O
, O
especially O
under O
the O
diverse O
pattern O
which O
is O
the B-TIME
twentieth I-TIME
century I-TIME
. O

In O
the O
days O
when O
most O
people O
were O
born O
, O
lived O
and O
died O
within O
the O
boundaries O
of O
the O
village O
, O
it O
was O
not O
difficult O
for O
anybody O
to O
live O
a O
day O
at O
a O
time O
. O

Even O
those O
who O
held O
a O
high O
and O
responsible O
office O
lived O
in O
far O
greater O
simplicity O
than O
their O
successors O
. O

When O
news O

took O
days B-TIME

from O

from O
the O

, O
months B-TIME
, O
even O
a O
Prime O

could O
go O

sleep O
in O
blissful O
ignorance O
of O
what O
might O
be O
happening O
at O
the O

of O
England B-LOCATION
, O
In O
other O
ways O
, O
too O
, O
life O
for O
the O
ordinary O
individual O
has O
become O
so O
complex O
that O
it O
taxes O
the O
mind O
. O

Two B-TIME
hundred I-TIME
years I-TIME
ago I-TIME
, O
men O
lived O
and O
worked O
in O
one B-CARDINAL
place O
, O
their O
lives O
were O
of O
one B-CARDINAL
piece O
. O

Now O
a O
man O
may O
live O
twenty B-CARDINAL
, O
thirty B-CARDINAL
even O
sixty B-CARDINAL
miles O
from O
his O
work O
. O

The O
only O
connexion O
is O
the O
pipeline O
of O
the O
railway O
on O
which O
they O
travel O
day O
by O
day O
. O

In O
many O
cases O
, O
their O
homes O
know O
little O
of O
their O
place O
of O
work O
and O
their O
associates O
at O
the O
office O
or O
works O
wonder O
what O
they O
are O
possibly O
like O
in O
the O
surroundings O
of O
their O
homes O
. O

It O
is O
easy O
, O
desperately O
easy O
, O
to O
lead O
a O
' O
double O
' O
life O
without O
ever O
deliberately O
planning O
to O
do O
so O
or O
in O
fact O
being O
conscious O
of O
what O
is O
going O
on O
. O

It O
is O
easier O
to O
live O
life O
in O
compartments O
but O
over O
the O
years O
it O
builds O
up O
, O
and O
to O
do O
so O
inevitably O
builds O
up O
tensions O
which O
need O
to O
be O
handled O
correctly O
. O

Can O
we O
then O
frame O
some O
' O
rules O
' O
which O
may O
enable O
us O
to O
live O
life O
as O
fully O
as O
possible O
, O
without O
having O
our O
energy O
sapped O
by O
un- O
necessary O
weariness O
. O

( O
a O
) O
Order O
makes O
for O
a O
decrease O
in O
tiredness O
. O

We O
have O
a O
saying O
' O
My O
head O
will O
never O
save O
my O
feet O
' O
. O

Time O
after O
time O
we O
forget O
something O
and O
have O
to O
go O
back O
upstairs O
or O
down O
to O
the O
shops O
. O

The O
housewife O
would O
find O
life O
far O
less O
tiring O
if O
she O
made O
a O
list O
, O
followed O
a O
routine O
of O
work O
rather O
than O
getting O
from O
one O
thing O
to O
the O
next O
. O

The O
business O
man O
would O
find O
that O
he O
reached O
the B-TIME
end I-TIME
of I-TIME
the I-TIME
day I-TIME
with O
far O
less O
strain O
if O
he O
was O
a O
little O
more O
systematic O
. O

To O
drift O
aimlessly O
along O
is O
more O
wearying O
than O
any- O
thing O
else O
. O

If O
we O
would O
only O
sit O
down O
and O
write O
out O
all O
the O
necessary O
jobs O
waiting O
to O
be O
done O
and O
then O
work O
quietly O
through O
them O
, O
we O
would O
find O
life O
considerably O
less O
exhausting O
I O
am O
more O
than O
conscious O
of O
this O
. O

How O
anybody O
can O
go O
through O
the O
same O
routine O
day O
in O
and O
day O
out O
for O
forty B-TIME
years I-TIME
I O
find O
difficult O
to O
understand O
. O

A O
lot O
of O
it O
is O
inevitable O
so O
that O
industry O
and O
commerce O
may O
be O
kept O
going O
- O
though O
if O
ever O
it O
becomes O
possible O
to O
work O
out O
a O
system O
of O
' O
staggered O
' O
hours O
it O
may O
do O
an O
immense O
amount O
of O
good O
over O
and O
above O
relieving O
the O
pressure O
on O
over-crowded O
trains O
. O

As O
it O
is O
, O
with O
so O
much O
of O
our O
life O
already O
in O
a O
predetermined O
groove O
, O
I O
would O
hardly O
like O
to O
add O
further O
to O
the O
dullness O
which O
it O
engenders O
. O

But O
I O
am O
not O
arguing O
for O
this O
. O

I O
know O
how O
much O
of O
a O
drag O
it O
can O
be O
and O
I O
was O
interested O
some O
little O
while O
ago O
to O
hear O
of O
a O
school O
who O
tried O
a O
six- B-TIME
day I-TIME
timetable O
. O

They O
only O
worked O
, O
of O
course O
, O
a B-TIME
five- I-TIME
day I-TIME
week I-TIME
so O
that O
in O
the B-TIME
first I-TIME
week I-TIME
Monday I-TIME
to I-TIME
Friday I-TIME
were O
days O
one B-CARDINAL
to O
five B-CARDINAL
of O
the O
timetable O
, O
the B-TIME
following I-TIME
Monday I-TIME
was O
day B-TIME
six I-TIME
and O
Tuesday B-TIME
started O
day B-TIME
one I-TIME
again O
and O
so O
on O
. O

By O
this O
means O
they O
avoided O
each B-TIME
week I-TIME
being O
the O
same O
with O
a O
pupil O
knowing O
exactly O
what O
the O
subject O
would O
be O
on O
Friday B-TIME
afternoon I-TIME
at O
3 B-TIME
p.m. I-TIME
. O

It O
was O
a O
little O
complicated O
to O
work O
, O
of O
course O
, O
and O
there O
had O
to O
be O
a O
big O
notice O
in O
the O
entrance O
saying O
which O
day O
of O
the O
timetable O
it O
was O
- O
but O
it O
added O
immensely O
to O
the O
interest O
and O
kept O
everybody O
on O
their O
toes O
. O

To O
have O
order O
does O
not O
mean O
getting O
into O
a O
dull O
routine O
. O

I O
have O
great O
sympathy O
with O
the O
young O
wife O
who O
does O
not O
always O
want O
to O
do O
the O
washing O
on O
a O
Monday B-TIME
. O

I O
would O
not O
want O
to O
either O
, O
but O
if O
she O
wants O
to O
get O
through O
the O
day O
without O
becoming O
exhausted O
, O
she O
will O
be O
well O
advised O
to O
sit O
down O
quietly O
and O
make O
a O
list O
of O
everything O
she O
has O
got O
to O
do O
, O
note O
the O
order O
in O
which O
they O
can O
most O
conveniently O
be O
done O
( O
or O
must O
be O
done O
because O
of O
other O
predetermined O
factors O
- O
you O
must O
, O
for O
example O
, O
do O
your O
shopping O
on O
the B-TIME
morning I-TIME
of O
the O
early O
closing O
day O
) O
. O

She O
will O
, O
in O
fact O
, O
be O
surprised O
at O
what O
peace O
of O
mind O
ensues O
. O

( O
b O
) O
Concentrate O
on O
one B-CARDINAL
thing O
at O
a O
time O
. O

A O
list O
or O
a O
plan O
enables O
us O
to O
put O
all O
our O
energies O
into O
the O
particular O
matter O
on O
hand O
. O

( O
Actually O
, O
the O
Mishnah O
quotes O
two B-CARDINAL
further O
proof O
texts O
and O
the O
Gemara O
explains O
why O
these O
, O
too O
, O
are O
necessary O
, O
but O
a O
careful O
examination O
of O
that O
passage O
makes O
it O
clear O
that O
these O
are O
not O
quoted O
here O
because O
they O
are O
not O
necessary O
to O
prove O
the O
point O
made O
by O

, O
we O
note O
that O

From O
the O
above O
it O
follows O
that O
here O
, O
once O
again O
, O
we O
have O
a O
good O
illustration O
of O
how O
a O
sugya O
has O
been O
fashioned O
from O
material O
already O
in O
the O
hands O
of O
the O

taken O
from O

There O
is O
no O

The O
question O

answer O
with O
regard O
to O
the O
need O
for O
the O
text O
of O
the O
angel O

quoted O

in O
the O
same O
words O
in O
which O
they O
are O
quoted O
in O
the O
discussion O
on O
the O
Mishnah O

This O
can O
either O
mean O
that O
both O
sugyas O
are O
quoting O
a O
well-known O
question O
and O
answer O
or O
that O
our O
sugya O
is O

from O
the O
longer O
sugya O
which O
deals O
with O
all O
four B-CARDINAL
texts O
quoted O
in O
the O
Mishnah O

Or O
it O
is O
possible O
that O
our O
sugya O
contains O
the O
original O
question O

and O
this O
is O
quoted O
in O
the O

whether O

The O

quoted O
and O
the O
interpretation O
of O
the O
latter O
part O
of O
the O
verse O
by O
Rami B-PERSON
bar I-PERSON
Rabh I-PERSON
is O
added O
, O
not O
because O
this O
is O
at O
all O
relevant O
to O
the O
discussion O
but O
because O
it O
was O
a O
familiar O
interpretation O
which O
had O
become O
so O
well O
known O
that O
it O
was O
invariably O
quoted O
whenever O
the O
verse O
itself O
was O
quoted O
, O
almost O
as O
if O
it O

a O
part O

The O
Gemara O
continues O
with O
a O
saying O
of O
the O
Palestinian B-NORP
teacher O
, O
R. B-PERSON
Eleazar I-PERSON
( O
3rd B-TIME
Cent. I-TIME
) O
: O
' O
The O
Holy O
Spirit O
manifested O
itself O
in O
three B-CARDINAL
places O
: O
the O
court O
of O
Shem B-PERSON
, O
the O
court O
of O
Samuel B-PERSON
of I-PERSON
Ramah I-PERSON
, O
and O
the O
court O
of O
Solomon B-PERSON
. O

' O
The O
place O
of O
this O
saying O
here O
is O
obvious O
, O
it O
follows O
naturally O
on O
the O
saying O
of O
R. B-PERSON
Joshua I-PERSON
b. I-PERSON
Levi I-PERSON
which O
deals O
with O
a O
similar O
theme O
. O

One O
can O
remember O
with O
horror O
the O
pictures O
of O
the O
overcrowded O
and O
over-embellished O
drawing-rooms O
complete O
with O
heavy O
crochet O
antimacassars O
, O
mantel- O
piece O
covers O
with O
a O
fringing O
of O
clumsy O
bobbles O
and O
numerous O
other O
crocheted O
pieces O
. O

It O
was O
some B-TIME
years I-TIME
after O
the O
Victorian B-TIME
period O
that O
designers O
realised O
the O
potentialities O
of O
the O
craft O
, O
and O
crochet O
was O
revived O
with O
designs O
suitable O
for O
contemporary O
trends O
. O

Crochet O
today B-TIME
has O
a O
variety O
of O
uses O
, O
and O
has O
even O
stepped O
into O
the O
field O
of O
high O
fashion O
. O

This O
could O
hardly O
happen O
without O
the O
herring O
having O
some O
orientation O
with O
the O
sea O
bottom O
. O

It O
means O
that O
the O
crowding O
is O
caused O
during O
the O
daytime O
, O
and O
that O
the O
herring O
must O
continue O
to O
migrate O

Thus O
we O
can O
see O
that O
herring O
movements O
, O
although O
primarily O
instinctive O
perhaps O
, O
and O
certainly O
helped O
and O
hindered O
by O
water O
flow O
, O
are O
also O
closely O
related O
to O
the O

Geography O
, O
too O
, O
names O
the O
great O
fisheries O
that O
depend O
on O
them O
: O
the O
Fladen B-LOCATION
Ground I-LOCATION
( O
where O
again O
most O
big O
shots O
are O
taken O
on O
the O
edges O
) O
, O
the O
Gut B-LOCATION
, O
a O
deep-water O
channel O
to O
the O
Dogger B-LOCATION
where O
the O
herring O
spawn O
along O
the O
northern O
In O
this O
200-fathom B-CARDINAL
trench O
the O
herring O
do O
not O
touch O
the O
bottom O
. O

Their O
descent O
stops O
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
light O
pressure O
. O

But O
they O
migrate O
easterly O
to O
the O
Norwegian B-NORP
side O
, O
or O
westerly O
, O
until O
in O
the O
shallower O
water O
the O
mile O
wide O
layers O
disappear O
from O
the O
echo-sounders O
. O

Bottom O
crowding O
comes O
when O
they O
cannot O
reach O
their O
optimum O
depth O
; O
and O
this O
coincides O
with O
the O
suitable O
gravelly O
soil O
of O
these O
many O
roughs O
where O
the O
spring- O
spawning O
herring O
are O
always O
found O
. O

The O
joint O
evidence O
of O
echo-sounders O
and O
fishing O
gear O
leads O
to O
an O
overall O
though O
somewhat O
dim O
picture O
. O

The O
details O
are O
harder O
still O
to O

Drift O
Effects O
. O

At O
East B-LOCATION
Anglia I-LOCATION
, O
for O
instance O
, O
shoals O
that O
gather O
at O
the O
Knoll B-LOCATION
or O
other O
banks O
are O
most O
of O
them O
going O
to O
travel O
a B-CARDINAL
hundred I-CARDINAL
miles O
farther O
south O
before O
they O
spawn O
. O

Some O
will O
spawn O
at O
the O
So O
the O
arrival O
of O
any O
particular O
shoal O
fish O
at O
a O
certain O
spawning O
ground O
may O
be O
accidental O
. O

Yet O
there O
will O
always O
be O
some O
that O
find O
it O
if O
enough O
are O
travelling O
, O
just O
as O
the O
robin O
who O
gets O
back O
exactly O
may O
be O
only B-CARDINAL
one I-CARDINAL
among O
thousands B-CARDINAL
who O
do O
not O
. O

But O
this O
southerly O
migration O
is O
not O
accidental O
. O

Being O
contranatant O
or O
against O
the O
drift O
, O
it O
probably O
has O
a O
survival O
value O
in O
ensuring O
that O
the O
fry O
after O
hatching O
are O
drifted O
back O
into O
the O
normal O
home O
Drift O
in O
another O
form O
probably O
explains O
how O
these O
migrating O
herring O
are O
biased O
to O
east O
or O
west O
by O
the O
different O
winds O
. O

Strong O
westerlies O
are O
well O
known O
to O
bring O
good O
longshore O
fishings O
. O

The O
surface O
water O
that O
is O
blown O
offshore O
must O
be O
replaced O
by O
an O
underflow O
bringing O
with O
it O
the O
herring O
to O
the O
Norfolk B-LOCATION
and O
Suffolk B-LOCATION
beaches O
. O

Easterly O
winds O
, O
on O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
mean O
no O
herring O
along O
the O
shore O
, O
as O
recent B-TIME
years I-TIME
have O
shown O
. O

A O
succession O
of O
winds O
is O
needed O
for O
this O
effect O
of O
course O
- O
one B-CARDINAL
breeze O
will O
not O
do O
it O
, O
though O
a O
very O
hard O
westerly O
will O
often O
start O
off O
the O
" O
local O
" O
herring O
; O
but O
quite O
apart O
from O
this O
wind O
effect O
there O
is O
an O
easterly O
drift O
special O
to O
this O
rump O
of O
coastline O
, O
caused O
by O
the O
meeting O
of O
water O
from O
north O
and O
south O
. O

Herring O
fishermen O
call O
this O
" O
the O
outset O
" O
. O

It O
is O
strongest O
at O
spring O
tides O
, O
when O
without O
wind O
you O
will O
" O
set O
" O
out O
- O
or O
drift O
to O
the O
east- O
ward O
, O
the O
length O
of O
half B-CARDINAL
a O
fleet O
of O
nets O
- O
almost O
a O
mile O
on O
every O
tide O
at O
the O
Smith's B-LOCATION
Knoll I-LOCATION
. O

Without O
an O
explanation O
of O
how O
it O
works O
, O
it O
may O
well O
be O
that O
this O
outset O
, O
akin O
to O
the O
mouth O
of O
a O
great O
salmon O
river O
, O
has O
been O
the O
biggest O
factor O
through O
the O
ages O
in O
the O
constancy O
of O
this O
great O
herring O
fishery O
. O

( O
Just O
how O
the O
seine O
ropes O
do O
this O
is O
not O
yet O
proved O
; O
it O
may O
be O
by O
actual O
contact O
, O
or O
by O
sight O
reaction O
to O
the O
disturbed O
sand O
; O
or O
even O
in O
the O
case O
of O
flat O
fish O
, O
by O
vibrations O
through O
or O
along O
the O
bottom O
. O

) O
But O
given O
such O
a O
bow O
wave O
of O
disturbance O
, O
it O
is O
obvious O
that O
without O
something O
to O
overcome O
its O
effect O
, O
very O
few O
fish O
would O
be O
caught O
. O

Let O
us O
consider O
first B-CARDINAL
what O
would O
appear O
to O
be O
the O
simplest O
case O
- O
that O
of O
flat O
fish O
on O
the O
bottom O
. O

The O
evidence O
suggest O
that O
the O
fish O
are O
aware O
of O
the O
moving O
footrope O
before O
it O
reaches O
them O
. O

They O
move O
away O
before O
it O
, O
swimming O
at O
the O
same O
speed O
for O
an O
unknown O
period O
of O
time O
, O
until O
they O
become O
( O
1 B-CARDINAL
) O
tired O
, O
or O
( O
2 B-CARDINAL
) O
more O
used O
to O
the O
disturbance O
. O

Then O
they O
stop O
swimming O
and O
are O
caught O
. O

In O
the O
seine-net O
film O
this O
usually O
seemed O
to O
happen O
just O
after O
the O
fish O
had O
risen O
above O
the O
footrope O
, O
and O
presumably O
out O
of O
its O
field O
of O
disturbance O
, O
or O
bow O
wave O
. O

This O
suggests O
that O
the O
wave O
might O
be O
transmitted O
by O
the O
sea-bed O
, O
though O
the O
footrope O
in O
this O
case O
was O
actually O
just O
off O
the O
bottom O
and O
was O
indeed O
passing O
over O
some O
fish O
. O

Actually O
the O
seine O
net O
has O
little O
or O
no O
cover O
. O

And O
in O
this O
film O
the O
rise O
of O
the O
fish O
was O
small O
, O
a O
matter O
of O
a O
foot O
or O
two B-CARDINAL
. O

With O
round O
fish O
like O
haddock O
, O
which O
would O
hardly O
find O
safety O
on O
the O
bottom O
, O
this O
cover O
would O
seem O
to O
be O
even O
more O
essential O
; O
but O
more O
films O
are O
needed O
to O
prove O
this O
. O

Cover O
in O
the O
fast-moving O
trawl O
is O
considered O
essential O
to O
catch O
round O
fish O
whose O
reaction O
to O
disturbance O
would O
be O
upwards O
. O

They O
also O
had O
to O
cope O
with O
the O
usual O
flood O
of O
rumours O
, O
so- O
me O
well O
meant O
, O
some O
mischievous O
, O
including O
one O
that O
a O
man O
had O
been O
seen O
fleeing O
from O
Vauxhall B-LOCATION
station O
on O
the O
Thursday B-TIME
evening I-TIME
, O
with O
blood O
actually O
dripping O
from O
his O
hands O
. O

The O
inquest O
was O
opened O
on O
February B-TIME
17 I-TIME
, O
but O
, O
beyond O
the O
jury O
hearing O
a O
formal O
identification O
of O
the O
victim O
and O
inspecting O
at O
Waterloo B-LOCATION
the O
carriage O
in O
which O
she O
had O
died O
, O
there O
was O
nothing O
on O
which O
to O
proceed O
, O
and O
the O
inquest O
was O
adjourned O
. O

Day O
by O
day O
the O
police O
followed O
up O
likely O
and O
even O
unlikely O
trails O
. O

It O
was O
learned O
that O
Elizabeth B-PERSON
Camp I-PERSON
had O
been O
lending O
money O
to O
her O
relatives O
, O
and O
her O
brother-in-law O
was O
asked O
for O
a O
detailed O
account O
of O
his O
movements O
on O
the B-TIME
11th I-TIME
. O

The O
dead O
woman O
had O
been O
engaged O
once O
before O
- O
to O
a O
barman O
named O
Brown B-PERSON
. O

This O
man O
agreed O
that O
his O
engagement O
had O
been O
broken O
off O
after O
one B-CARDINAL
particular O
tiff O
, O
but O
denied O
that O
he O
owed O
Miss O
Camp B-PERSON
any O
money O
. O

All O
the O
while O
the O
police O
were O
casting O
about O
for O
a O
man O
who O
had O
been O
seen O
leaving O
the O
train O
at O
Wandsworth B-LOCATION
. O

A O
passenger O
described O
this O
individual O
as O
a O
man O
of O
about B-CARDINAL
thirty I-CARDINAL
, O
of O
medium O
height O
, O
with O
a O
dark O
moustache O
, O
and O
wearing O
a O
frockcoat O
and O
a O
top-hat O
. O

The O
porter O
at O
the O
station O
bore O
out O
this O
description O
, O
but O
the O
man O
was O
not O
traced O
. O

Perhaps O
the O
news O
of O
their O
search O
got O
around O
, O
for O
a O
man O
did O
obligingly O
present O
himself O
at O
Wandsworth B-LOCATION
police-station O
, O
claiming O
to O
have O
committed O
the O
murder O
- O
but O
he O
was O
mentally O
defective O
, O
and O
, O
despite O
his O
claim O
to O
infamy O
, O
had O
been O
nowhere O
near O
the O
7.42 B-CARDINAL
that B-TIME
evening I-TIME
. O

And O
so O
the O
inquest O
, O
which O
had O
dragged O
on O
, O
with O
adjournments O
, O
until O
April B-TIME
7 I-TIME
, O
finally O
had O
to O
be O
content O
to O
return O
a O
verdict O
of O
" O
wilful O
murder O
against O
some O
person O
or O
persons O
unknown O
. O

" O
The O
most O
vital O
clue O
of O
the O
Wedgwood B-ORGANIZATION

The O
killer O
must O
have O
been O
very O
thankful O
that O
the O
science O
of O
dactyloscopy O
was O
only O
in O
its O
beginnings O
. O

The O
next O
female O
fatality O
occurred O
eight B-TIME
years I-TIME
later I-TIME
, O
yet O
so O
strange O
were O
the O
circumstances O
that O
it O
was O
a B-TIME

before O

There O
has O
always O
been O
something O
sinister O
in O
the O
idea O
of O
tunnels O
. O

The O
building O
of O
them O
was O
one O
of O
the O
most O
dangerous O
jobs O
con- O
nected O
with O
railway O
construction O
; O
and O
there O
were O
many O
people O
who O
believed O
that O
to O
travel O
through O
tunnels O
would O
be O
an O
equally O
hazardous O
business O
. O

Some O
thought O
that O
the O
result O
would O
be O
all O
sorts O
of O
horrible O
illnesses O
brought O
on O
by O
the O
confined O
atmosphere O
. O

" O
The O
shareholders O
who O
travel O
by O
it O
will O
be O
so O
heartily O
sick O
, O
what O
with O
the O
foul O
air O
, O
smoke O
and O
sulphur O
, O
that O
the O
mention O
of O
a O
railway O
will O
be O
worse O
than O
Ipecacuanha O

" O
wrote O
an O
anti-railway O
industrialist O
when O
it O
was O
proposed O
to O
build O
the O
Box B-LOCATION
Tunnel I-LOCATION
. O

The O
mere O
thought O
of O
subterranean O
travel O
gave O
others O
a O
feeling O
of O
danger O
. O

A O
medical O
journal O
said O
, O
" O
the O
deafening O
peal O
of O
thunder O
, O
the O
sudden O
immersion O
in O
gloom O
, O
and O
the O
clash O
of O
reverberated O
sounds O
in O
a O
confined O
space O
combine O
to O
produce O
a O
momentary O
shudder O
, O
or O
idea O
of O
destruction O
, O
a O
thrill O
of O
annihilation O
. O

" O
It O
was O
also O
prophesied O
that O
passengers O
would O
be O
robbed O

assaulted O
in O
the O
darkness O

For O
all O
that O
, O
as O
far O
as O
England B-LOCATION
is O
concerned O
, O
there O
have O
been O
only B-CARDINAL
two I-CARDINAL
occasions O
on O
which O
a O
body O
has O
been O
found O
in O
a O

in O
circumstances O
pointing O
to O

The O
first B-CARDINAL
was O
that O
of O
Mr O

in O
the O
famous O
Lefroy B-PERSON
case O
, O
and O
by O
an O
odd O

the O
second B-CARDINAL
tragedy O
occurred O
on O
the O

although O
this O
time O
the O
victim O
was O
a O

Though O
in O
the O
minds O

most O
people O
there O
was O
no O
doubt O
that O
the O
woman O
had O
been O
the O
victim O

foul O

the O
verdict O
brought O

It O
was O
the O

He O
sent O
word O
straight O
away O

Merstham B-LOCATION
Station I-LOCATION

and O
a O
stretcher O
party O
took O
the O

to O
the O
Feathers B-LOCATION

to O
await O

Was O
it O
a O
case O
of O
suicide O
, O
where O
some O
unhappy O
soul O
had O
walked O
deliberately O
into O
the O
blackness O
and O
into O
the O
path O
of O
some O
train O
? O

This O
hardly O
seemed O
likely O
, O
since O
, O
when O
she O
was O
examined O
by O
a O
local O
doctor O
, O
the O
woman O
, O
young O
, O
small O
, O
and O
rather O
plump O
, O
was O
found O
to O
have O
her O
own O
silk O
scarf O
drawn O
almost O
tight O
enough O
to O
strangle O
her O
, O
and O
the O
ends O
thrust O
in O
her O
mouth O
like O
a O
gag O
. O

Both O
her O
wrists O
bore O
the O
marks O
of O
severe O
bruising O
, O
and O
there O
were O
other O
injuries O
on O
her O
body O
which O
had O
occurred O
before O
her O
death O
was O
ensured O
by O
some O
train O
which O
had O
roared O
through O
the O
tunnel O
. O

There O
were O
no O
letters O

papers O
found O
on O
her O
to O
assist O
identi O
fication O
, O
no O
money O
, O
and O
no O
railway O

By O
then O
reports O
were O
being O
gathered O
about O
all O
traffic O
over O
this O
stretch O

but O
no O

any O

reporting O
an O

So O
the O
body O
of O
this O
small O

with O
the O
blue O
eyes O
and O
long O
brown O

in O
a O

at O
the O

remained O
a O

During O
that O

a O
description O
of O

The O

It O
is O
not O
our O
purpose O
to O
discuss O
this O
dictum O
. O

Suffice O
to O
say O
that O
few O
of O
us O
stop O
to O
marvel O
at O
the O
progress O
of O
civilisation O
which O
allows O
a O
dish O
borrowed O
straight O
from O
the O
prehistoric O
. O

How O
many O
centuries O
ago O
, O
in O
some O
cave O
or O
hilly O
hide O
, O
did O
our O
forebears O
home O
from O
the O
chase O
hold O
forth O
from O
a O
spear O
the O
welcome O
gobbet O
of O
meat O
or O
fish O
burnt O
and O
roasted O
in O
the O
homely O
and O
protecting O
flame O
. O

How O
many O
centuries O
later O
did O
the O
mercenary O
in O
the O
Roman B-NORP
wars O
thus O
impale O
on O
pike O
or O
lance O
his O
evening O
meal O
. O

Later O
came O
the O
thrifty O
peasant O
, O
later O
still O
the O
young O
Victorian B-NORP
buck O
adventuring O
in O
Paris B-LOCATION
, O
and O
even O
later O
our O
attractive O
young O
ladies O
toying O
with O
these O
primitive O
morsels O
in O
the O
gleam O
and O
glitter O
of O
our O
latter-day O
restaurants O
. O

And O
, O
if O
certain O
dishes O
and O
modes O
of O
food O
have O
persisted O
down O
the O
ages O
, O
the O
motive O
that O
preserved O
them O
has O
always O
been O
the O
same O
. O

Apart O
from O
the O
need O
for O
nourishment O
, O
the O
instinct O
of O
hospitality O
has O
always O
been O
strong O
in O
mankind O
. O

The O
sharing O
of O
a O
meal O
in O
those O
earliest O
dangerous O
days O
was O
an O
admittance O
into O
an O
acquaintanceship O
far O
more O
important O
than O
the O
casual O
meetings O
of O
the B-TIME
present I-TIME
day I-TIME
; O
the O
desire O
to O
share O
something O
more O
intimate O
than O
mere O
converse O
has O
always O
been O
there O
. O

The O
truth O
is O
that O
good O
food O
offers O
a O
programme O
of O
entertainment O
almost O
unlimited O
in O
its O
variety O
and O
its O
presen- O
tation O
affords O
an O
opportunity O
of O
showing O
a O
guest O
something O
of O
ourselves O
. O

It O
is O
a O
far O
enough O
cry O
from O
the O
primitive O
meal-times O
of O
a O
simpler O
world O
to O
the O
banquets O
of O
later O
days O
, O
when O
the O
table O
groaned O
under O
its O
load O
of O
complicated O
dishes O

and O
for O
all O
the O

of O
the O
arts O
around O
them O
the O

always O

When O
, O
however O
, O
the O
Greeks B-NORP
did O
learn O
the O
art O
of O
making O
fireproof O
earthenware O
from O
the O
Egyptians B-NORP
, O
their O
cookery O
made O
rapid O
progress O
, O
because O
they O
were O
men O
of O
taste O
and O
intellect O
. O

A O
remarkable O
peculiarity O
in O
the O
banquets O
of O
the O
ancient O
world O
was O
the O
fact O
that O
they O
did O
not O
confine O
the O
resources O
of O
the O
table O
to O
the O
gratification O
of O
one B-CARDINAL
sense O
alone O
. O

Having O
exhausted O
their O
invention O
in O
the O
preparation O
of O
stimulants O
for O
the O
palate O
, O
they O
broke O
fresh O
ground O
and O
called O
another O
sense O
to O
their O
aid O
. O

By O
delicate O
application O
of O
odours O
and O
richly-distilled O
perfumes O
, O
these O
refined O
voluptuaries O
aroused O
the O
fainting O
appetite O
and O
added O
a O
more O
exquisite O
and O
ethereal O
enjoyment O
to O
the O
grosser O
pleasures O
of O
the O
board O
. O

The O
gratification O
of O
the O
sense O
of O
smelling O
was O
a O
subject O
of O
no O
little O
importance O
to O
the O
Romans B-NORP
. O

They O
considered O
flowers O
as O
forming O
a O
very O
essential O
article O
in O
their O
festal O
preparations O
; O
and O
it O
is O
the O
opinion O
of O
Bassius B-PERSON
that O
at O
their O
desserts O
the O
number O
of O
flowers O
far O
exceeded O
the O
number O
of O
fruits O
. O

According O
to O
Pliny B-PERSON
, O
and O
others O
, O
certain O
herbs O
and O
flowers O
proved O
of O
sovereign O
power O
clarifying O
the O
functions O
of O
the O
brain O
. O

It O
is O
said O
that O
there O
is O
nothing O
new O
under O
the O
sun O
, O
but O
regarding O
foodstuffs O
the O
traveller O
occasionally O
encounters O
a O
certain O
measure O
of O
novelty O
. O

In O
China B-LOCATION
, O
for O
instance O
, O
dried O
rats O
are O
esteemed O
a O
delicacy O
. O

The O
visitor O
is O
told O
that O
they O
restore O
the O
hair O
of O
the O
bald O
and O
that O
a O
stewed O
black O
rat O
will O
ward O
off O
a O
fever O
. O

A O
number O
of O
newly-born O
white O
mice O
served O
alive O
, O
dipped O
in O
treacle O
and O
swallowed O
like O
a O
prairie O
oyster O

considered O
a O
piece O
of O
resistance O

Among O
the O
natives O
of O
Northern B-LOCATION
Australia I-LOCATION
lizards O
roasted O
on O
the O
point O
of O
a O
spear O
are O
definitely O
a O
delicacy O

Mediterranean B-LOCATION
peoples O
have O
a O
high O
opinion O
of O
the O

as O
an O
article O

of O

all O

It O
was O
naturally O
a O
highly O
popular O
victory O
with O
the O
Londoners B-NORP
, O
but O
it O
brought O
heavy O
censure O
from O
nobles O

still O
believed O
that O

had O
a O
monopoly O

But O

at O

de B-PERSON
Vienne I-PERSON
avoided O
trouble O
at O

as O
cleverly O
as O
Du B-PERSON
Guesclin I-PERSON
avoided O
it O
on O

Gaunt B-PERSON
was O
compelled O
to O
give O
up O
his O
search O
for O
an O
elusive O
foe O
, O
and O
, O
afraid O
to O
return O
home O
without O
something O
to O
show O
, O
he O
foolishly O
attempted O
to O
besiege O
the O
well-protected O
fortress O
of O
St B-LOCATION
Malo I-LOCATION
. O

This O
involved O
the O
dreary O
method O
of O
mining O
operations O
in O
which O
Gaunt B-PERSON
, O
under O
the O
Black B-PERSON
Prince I-PERSON
, O
had O
shown O
considerable O
skill O
at O
the O
siege O
of O

When O
all O
seemed O
to O
be O
going O
well O
, O
a O
sortie O
surprised O
moment O
had O
charge O
of O
the O
mine O
; O
the O
mine O
collapsed O
fame O
and O
glory O
. O

Gaunt B-PERSON
was O
compelled O
to O
return O
even O
despised O
failure O
. O

The O
' O
ribald O
' O
Londoners B-NORP
, O
who O
Hawley B-PERSON
, O
were O
also O
expressing O
their O
disappointment O
comparing O
the O
failure O
of O
a O
subsidized O
duke O

These O
dreary O
years B-TIME
of O
ineffective O
fighting O
provide O
obvious O
morals O
for O
those O
who O
are O
judges O
long O
after O
the O
event O
. O

It O
seems O
obvious O
that O
, O
though O
the O
longbows O
of O
yeomen O
could O
pierce O
the O
plate O
and O
mail O
of O
French B-NORP
knights O
, O
a O
brilliant O
battle O
was O
no O
substitute O
for O
a O
sound O
policy O
, O
and O
that O
, O
if O
archers O
had O
no O
target O
, O
campaigns O
became O
mere O
marauding O
route O
marches O
. O

It O
seems O
obvious O
that O
if O
an O
expedition O
to O
Brittany B-LOCATION
was O
compelled O
to O
attack O
via O
Calais B-LOCATION
, O
then O
the O
primary O
essential O
to O
the O
success O
of O
the O
French B-NORP
war O
was O
a O
navy O
in O
unquestioned O
command O
of O
the O
Channel B-LOCATION
. O

It O
seems O
obvious O
that O
divided O
forces O
were O
dissipating O
the O
advantages O
of O
a O
ring O
of O
bridge-heads O
which O
included O
Calais B-LOCATION
, O
Cherbourg B-LOCATION
, O
Brest B-LOCATION
, O
Bordeaux B-LOCATION
and O
Bayonne B-LOCATION
, O
and O
that O
there O
was O
no O
hope O
of O
final O
victory O
without O
a O
large-scale O
and O
concentrated O
invasion O
. O

In O
this O
cruel O
process O
which O
was O
hammering O
out O
nations O
on O
the O
anvils O
of O
war O
, O
there O
was O
a O
constant O
stirring O
of O
those O
in O
authority O
to O
find O
some O
simple O
way O
out O
of O
the O
complicated O
financial O
6impasse O
which O
always O
resulted O
, O
and O
in O
the O
story O
of O
the O
experiments O
and O
expedients O
to O
which O
the O
Exchequer B-ORGANIZATION
resorted O
is O
the O
story O
of O
the O
prelude O
to O
the O
Peasants' B-ORGANIZATION
Revolt O
of O
1381 B-TIME
. O

In O
appreciating O
this O
story O
, O
modern O
con- O
ceptions O
of O
governmental O
duties O
must O
be O
set O
aside O
. O

A O
modern O
government O
needs O
taxation O
not O
merely O
for O
defence O
and O
offence O
but O
for O
a O
very O
wide O
range O
of O
social O
services O
. O

A O
mediaeval O
oligarchy O
needed O
taxation O
in O
order O
to O
supplement O
the O
private O
wealth O
of O
the O
monarchy O
( O
the O
royal O
income O
from O
the O
revenues O
of O
crown O
lands O
, O
the O
fees O
of O
feudalism O
Social O
service O
as O
a O
function O
of O
government O
was O
quite O
alien O
to O
mediaeval O
thought O
- O
its O
substitute O
was O
the O
mutual O
self-help O
of O
communities O
, O
whether O
those O
communities O
were O
monasteries O
, O
manors O
, O
townships O
, O
or O
wards O
and O
guilds O
of O
a O
city O
. O

A O
mediaeval O
tax O
was O
therefore O
in O
essence O
a O
forced O
payment O
whose O
return O
was O
the O
uncertain O
bounty O
of O
booty O
and O
the O
vague O
advantages O
of O
military O
glory O
; O
it O
was O
therefore O
always O
granted O
grudgingly O
and O
coupled O
with O
the O
vain O
hope O
that O
, O
in O
the O
When O
' O
his O
' O
war O
did O
not O
bring O
victory O
and O
booty O
, O
a O
new O
group O
of O
Lords O
might O
oust O
the O
unsuccessful O
leaders O
, O
and O
the O
Commons B-ORGANIZATION
, O
who O
usually O
supplied O
the O
hard O
cash O
, O
might O
be O
bold O
enough O
to O
demand O
the O
production O
of O
accounts O
, O
and O
even O
at O
times O
the O
impeachment O
of O
the O
unsuccessful O

But O
the O
Commons B-ORGANIZATION
were O
not O
the O
people O
, O
and O
even O
a O
full O
Parliament B-ORGANIZATION
was O
not O
yet O
a O
true O
mirror O
of O
the O
nation O

The O

- O
Langland's B-PERSON
' O

were O

None O
of O
these O
classes O

except O
the O

During O
the B-TIME
four- I-TIME
teenth I-TIME
century I-TIME
, O
the O
traditional O
methods O
of O
financing O
the O
Exchequer O
had O
become O
stabilized O
. O

When O
the O
King O
and O
his O
Council B-ORGANIZATION
required O
additio- O
nal O
funds O
, O
they O
were O
usually O
granted O
an O
export O
tax O
on O
the O
wool O
trade O
, O
collected O
by O
means O
of O
that O
' O
staple O
' O
system O
which O
ensured O
that O
prices O
, O
quality O
and O
tax O
could O
be O
efficiently O
su- O
pervised O
and O
controlled O
, O
together O
with O
a O
There O
were O
two B-CARDINAL
other O
sources O
of O
public O
revenue O
- O
first B-CARDINAL
, O
the O
Church B-ORGANIZATION
, O
which O
wisely O
followed O
the O
lead O
of O
the O
Commons B-ORGANIZATION
and O
in O
its O
own O
Convocations O
granted O
equivalent O
contributions O
, O
and O
second B-CARDINAL
, O
the O
foreign O
merchants O
, O
with O
whom O
the O
King's O
officials O
had O
formerly O
made O
private O
bargains O
at O
' O
colloquies O
of O
merchants O
' O
, O
and O
whose O
payments O
were O
now O
authorized O
by O
parliamentary O
sanction O
at O
a O
rate O
roughly B-CARDINAL
fifty I-CARDINAL
per O
cent O
in O
excess O
of O
the O
rate O
for O
native O
merchants O
. O

In O
addition O
to O
these O
revenues O
, O
the O
King O
had O
the O
financial O
benefits O
of O
his O
position O
at O
the O
head O
of O
the O
feudal O
system O
, O
as O
its O
chief O
landowner O
and O
the O
recipient O
of O
the O
fines O
of O
royal O
justice O
. O

It O
was O
, O
therefore O
, O
a O
complicated O
and O
not O
very O
satisfactory O
financial O
system O
in O
which O
the O
borders O
between O
private O
and O
public O
purse O
were O
as O
ill-defined O
as O
the O
borders O
between O
private O
and O
national O
war O
, O
and O
in O
which O
the O
comparati- O
vely O
simple O
obligations O
of O
the O
feudal O
pyramid O
But O
this O
time O
there O
was O
a O
very O
interesting O
attempt O
to O
apply O
a O
sliding O
scale O
to O
the O
payments O
demanded O
. O

The O
definition O
of O
an O
adult O
was O
altered O
to O
read O
' O
over B-CARDINAL
sixteen I-CARDINAL
' O
, O
and O
, O
where O
the O
poorest O
were O
to O
pay O
a O
groat O
, O
the O
Duke O
of O
Lancaster B-LOCATION
and O
the O
Archbishops O
of O
Canterbury B-LOCATION
and O
York B-LOCATION
were O
to O
pay O
ten B-CARDINAL
marks O
, O
and O
between O
these O
two B-CARDINAL
extremes O
a O
graduated O
scale O
of O
payments O
was O
fixed O
for O
the O
different O
classes O
of O
laymen O
and O
clerics O
. O

Again O
the O
resentment O
was O
widespread O
and O
the O
results O
disappointing O
- O
a O
tax O
estimated O
to O
yield O
50,000 B-CARDINAL
in O
fact O
raised O
only B-CARDINAL
27,000 I-CARDINAL
. O

In O
the B-TIME
following I-TIME
year I-TIME
, O
1380 B-TIME
, O
the O
last O
and O
most O
notorious O
third B-CARDINAL
poll-tax O
was O
agreed O
by O
a O
Parliament B-ORGANIZATION
which O
met O
at O
Northampton B-LOCATION
. O

There O
were O
dark O
reasons O
for O
a O
meeting O
so O
far O
away O
from O
the O
capital O
in O
a O
town O
with O
poor O
communications O
and O
not O
over O
supplied O
with O
hostelries O
and O
lodgings O
. O

London B-LOCATION
was O
again O
in O
turmoil O
; O
but O
this O
time O
over O
a O
question O
of O
trade O
rivalry O
. O

A O
rich O
mer- O
chant O
from O
Genoa B-LOCATION
had O
been O
murdered O
, O
and O
John B-PERSON
de I-PERSON
Kyrkby I-PERSON
, O
a O
Londoner B-NORP
, O
was O
one O
of O
those O
charged O
with O
the O
crime O
. O

It O
is O
clear O
from O
the O
chronicles O
that O
this O
was O
a O
sordid O
quarrel O
between O
monopolists O
and O
interlopers O
. O

The O
city O
merchants O
were O
jealous O
of O
foreign O
merchants O
who O
could O
tempt O
court O
and O
baronage O
with O
rarer O
luxuries O
than O
those O
Trebling O
the O
rate O
was O
arrived O
at O
by O
a O
simple O
arithmetic O
which O
argued O
that O
, O
as O
the O
first B-CARDINAL
poll-tax O
had O
supplied O
22,000 B-CARDINAL
, O
a O
tax O
of O
three B-CARDINAL
times O
the O
rate O
would O
produce O
66,000 B-CARDINAL
. O

The O
only O
concession O
made O
in O
view O
of O
the O
objections O
to O
the O
first B-CARDINAL
two I-CARDINAL
poll-taxes O
was O
the O
suggestion O
that O
the O
rich O
should O
help O
the O
poor O
- O
but O
this O
was O
only O
a O
pious O
hope O
because O
no O
machinery O
was O
provided O
for O
carrying O
it O
into O
effect O
, O
and O
a O
subordinate O
In O
Chapter O
Two B-CARDINAL
he O
gauged O
the O
nature O
of O
the O
heart's O
movements O
from O
the O
dissection O
of O
living O
animals O
, O
showing O
how O
these O
move- O
ments O
alternate O
with O
rests O
and O
are O
seen O
best O
in O
cold O
animals O
or O
in O
flagging O
warmer O
ones O
. O

At O
the O
time O
of O
its O
movement O
the O
heart O
becomes O
generally O
constricted O
, O
its O
walls O
thicken O
, O
its O
ventricles O
decrease O
in O
volume O
and O
it O
expels O
its O
content O
of O
blood O
, O
appearing O
paler O
in O
so O
doing O
in O
animals O
such O
as O
serpents O
, O
frogs O
, O
and O
the O
like O
. O

At O
one B-CARDINAL
and O
the O
same O
time O
, O
therefore O
, O
occur O
the O
beat O
of O
the O
apex O
, O
the O
thickening O
of O
the O
heart O
walls O
, O
and O
the O
forcible O
expulsion O
of O
their O
contained O
blood O
by O
the O
contraction O
of O
the O
ventricles O
. O

Going O
on O
in O
Chapter O
Three B-CARDINAL
to O
the O
movement O
of O
the O
arteries O
, O
likewise O
gauged O
from O
the O
dissections O
of O
living O
animals O
, O
Harvey B-PERSON
noted O
that O
contraction O
of O
the O
heart O
and O
the O
apex O
beat O
occur O
in O
systole O
, O
simultaneously O
with O
dilatation O
of O
the O
arteries O
and O
of O
the O
artery-like O
vein O
, O
and O
expulsion O
of O
the O
ventricular O
content O
. O

Arterial O
pulsation O
disappears O
with O
cessation O
of O
ventricular O
contraction O
. O

During O
cutting O
or O
puncture O
of O
the O
ventricles O
, O
there O
is O
often O
forcible O
expulsion O
of O
blood O
from O
the O
wound O
. O

Arterial O
diastole O
is O
thus O
synchronous O
with O
cardiac O
systole O
but O
, O
when O
movement O
of O
blood O
through O
arteries O
is O
hindered O
by O
compression O
, O
infarction O
or O
inter- O
ception O
, O
the O
more O
distal O
arteries O
pulsate O
less O
because O
their O
pulse O
is O
nothing O
other O
than O
the O
impulse O
of O
the O
blood O
entering O
them O

And O

the O

Being O

George B-PERSON
won O

One O

Although O
his O

, O
though O
at O
this O

he O
was O
a O

. O

After O
the O
First B-CARDINAL
World O
War O
, O
1914 B-TIME
, O
I O
did O
not O
visit O
Germany B-LOCATION
for O
ten B-TIME
years I-TIME
, O
by O
which O
time O
in O
1924 B-TIME
I O
was O
in O
a O
different O
parish O
in O
Surrey B-LOCATION
. O

Towards O
the O
end O
of O
my O
five B-TIME
and I-TIME
a I-TIME
half I-TIME
years' I-TIME
incumbency O
I O
was O
asked O
if O
I O
would O
start O
a O
village O
choral O
society O
and O
conduct O
it O
. O

This O
opened O
up O
a O
new O
interest O
, O
and O
we O
plunged O
into O
it O
. O

But O
what O
a O
change O
from O
the O
dear O
little O
old O
church O
at O
Tatsfield B-LOCATION
to O
the O
great O
modern O
church O
of O
St. B-LOCATION
Mark's I-LOCATION
at O
Purley B-LOCATION
. O

One O
felt O
at O
Tatsfield B-LOCATION
that O
, O
small O
as O
the O
church O
was O
, O
it O
had O
its O
own O
atmosphere O
, O
and O
for O
centuries B-TIME
had O
been O
a O
House O
of O
Prayer O
. O

I O
could O
not O
but O
feel O
the O
chilliness O
of O
the O
new O
church O
, O
beautiful O
as O
it O
was O
and O
is O
. O

When O
we O
had O
found O
a O
group O
of O
people O
who O
gladly O
co-operated O
, O
we O
made O
the O
little O
side O
chapel O
a O
place O
of O
daily O
prayer O
. O

I O
suggested O
to O
the O
congregation O
that O
it O
needed O
warming O
up O
by O
constant O
prayer O
and O
worship O
, O
and O
we O
found O
many O
to O
help O
. O

Gifts O
of O
candlesticks O
and O
stained-glass O
lancet O
windows O
- O
finally O
a O
new O
altar O
- O
helped O
to O
furnish O
the O
chapel O
as O
a O
little O
sanctuary O
for O
prayer O
and O
quiet O
. O

In O
time O
we O
received O
similar O
gifts O
for O
the O
High O
Altar O
, O
and O
large O
East O
and O
West O
windows O
. O

It O
was O
very O
interesting O
to O
have O
the O
privilege O
of O
filling O
such O
a O
beautiful O
building O
with O
suitable O
fittings O
; O
I O
made O
a O
rule O
that O
all O
gifts O
should O
be O
submitted O
for O
approval O
to O
the O
architect O
, O
himself O
a O
fine O
artist O
. O

It O
is O
quite O
possible O
to O
put O
beautiful O
things O
into O
a O
beautiful O
church O
and O
yet O
spoil O
the O
building O
with O
ornaments O
unsui- O
table O
to O
the O
environs O
. O

Meanwhile O
in O
Purley B-LOCATION
there O
was O
much O
activity O
and O
much O
co-operation O
especially O
with O
the O
other O
Christian B-NORP
communities O
. O

At O
a O
large O
public O
meeting O
we O
launched O
the O
project O
known O
as O
the O
' O
Coulsdon B-ORGANIZATION
and I-ORGANIZATION
Purley I-ORGANIZATION
Patriotic I-ORGANIZATION
Fund I-ORGANIZATION
' O
in O
whose O
counsels O
and O
committees O
I O
found O
myself O
deeply O
involved O
. O

At O
first B-CARDINAL
, O
the O
main O
work O
was O
to O
help O
wives O
and O
relations O
of O
the O
soldiers O
to O
get O
their O
' O
Separation O
' O
allowances O
, O
but O
soon O
, O
alas O
! O

, O
as O
casualties O
began O
and O
increased O
in O
the B-TIME
winter I-TIME
of I-TIME
1914 I-TIME
and I-TIME
1915 I-TIME
the O
matter O
of O
War O
Pensions O
became O
very O
urgent O
, O
and O
I O
was O
asked O
to O
be O
Chairman O
of O
the O
Committee B-ORGANIZATION
in O
Coulsdon B-LOCATION
and O
Purley B-LOCATION
. O

Indeed O
, O
for O
the O
next O
seventeen B-TIME
years I-TIME
, O
during O
my O
time O
at O
Purley B-LOCATION
, O
and O
from O
1922 B-TIME
at O
Surbiton B-LOCATION
, O
I O
was O
continuously O
Chairman O
of O
the O
local O
War B-ORGANIZATION
Pensions I-ORGANIZATION
Committee I-ORGANIZATION
. O

This O
task O
involved O
a O
very O
great O
deal O
of O
detailed O
work O
for O
the O
Committee B-ORGANIZATION
. O

We O
had O
a O
splendid O
body O
of O
local O
residents O
, O
and O
a O
series O
of O
excellent O
Honorary O
Secretaries O
. O

Our O
Committee B-ORGANIZATION
met O
once O
a O
week O
in O
the O
evenings O
, O
and O
included O
professional O
men O
from O
every O
walk O
of O
life O
. O

When O
he O
saw O
Trelawny's B-PERSON
printed O
letter O
, O
Lord O
Sidney B-PERSON
wrote O
to O
Douglas B-PERSON
Kinnaird I-PERSON
saying O
that O
it O
was O
incorrect O
throughout O
. O

He O
had O
no O
sooner O
heard O
from O
Count O
Gamba B-PERSON
and O
Fletcher B-PERSON
that O
Byron B-PERSON
would O
have O
wished O
his O
body O
to O
return O
to O
England B-LOCATION
than O
that O
course O
was O
' O
immediately O
carried O
into O
effect O
' O
- O
not O
in O
spite O
of O
himself O
and O
Sir O
Frederick B-PERSON
Stoven I-PERSON
, O
but O
with O
their O
perfect O
con- O
currence O
, O
while O
' O
General O
Adam B-PERSON
was O
at O
Corfu B-LOCATION
the O
whole O
time O
and O
 O
never O
interfered O
in O
the O
slightest O
degree O
about O
the O
matter O
' O
. O

Their O
friendship O
for O
Augusta B-PERSON
became O
rather O
hollow O
, O
and O
the O
news O
that O
Byron B-PERSON
had O
left O
her O
practically O
all O
his O
money O
caused O
it O
to O
crumble O
to O
oblivion O
. O

Though O
Lady O
Byron B-PERSON
knew O
perfectly O
well O
that O
Byron B-PERSON
, O
as O
early O
as O
the O
year O
of O
their O
wedding O
, O
1815 B-TIME
, O
had O
made O
a O
will O
in O
Augusta's B-PERSON
favour O
, O
she O
had O
evidently O
not O
passed O
on O
that O
information O
; O
and O
it O
came O
as O
an O
appalling O
surprise O
to O
Captain O
Byron B-PERSON
that O
he O
had O
been O
left O
without O
the O
fortune O
that O
would O
keep O
up O
the O
title O
. O

He O
rose O
from O
his O
breakfast-nook O
bench O
and O
came O
into O
the O
livingroom O
, O
where O
Heather B-PERSON
and O
Steve B-PERSON
stood O
aghast O
at O
his O
entrance O
. O

He O
came O
, O
almost O
falling O
forward O
in O
an O
ungainly O
shuffle O
, O
neck O
thrust O
out O
, O
arms O
dangling O
loosely O
. O

Then O
, O
abruptly O
, O
he O
drew O
himself O
up O
and O
walked O
on O
the O
very O
tips O
of O
his O
toes O
. O

He O
stretched O
his O
arms O
over O
his O
head O
and O
yawned O
agape O
, O
drawing-in O
great O
breaths O
that O
became O
great O
sighs O
of O
ecstacy O
. O

" O
They O
have O
come O
! O

" O
he O
said O
reverently O
, O
gripping O
his O
hands O
together O
between O
his O
knees O
and O
leaning O
forward O
. O

" O
Isn't O
it O
a O
glorious O
thing O
! O

Long O
awaited O
transcendent O
event O

the O

" O
He O
turned O
beaming O
eyes O
upward O
and O
shook O
his O
head O
slowly O
from O
side O
to O
side O
. O

A O
superfluous O
precaution O
for O
there O
was O
no O
other O
car O
abroad O
; O
and O
no O
pedestrian O
to O
cross O
his O
path O
nor O
to O
wait O
at O
an O
intersection O
for O
the O
light O
to O
change O
. O

At O
his O
apartment O
he O
garaged O
his O
car O
and O
then O
stood O
listening O
in O
the O
night O
. O

Listening O
in O
vain O
. O

For O
the O
earth O
had O
lost O
its O
life-tempo O
, O
as O
the O
heart O
loses O
its O
beat O
in O
death O

Deadly O
stillness O
, O
deadly O
portent O

Steve B-PERSON
awakened O
early O
and O
switched O
on O
the O
radio O
, O
which O
he O
kept O
tuned O
to O
CBO. B-ORGANIZATION
The O
set O
lighted-up O
but O
gave O
only O
a O
low O
buzzing O
sound O
. O

He O
had O
just O
finished O
shaving O
when O
it O
came O
on O
, O
with O
a O
flat O
voice O
repeating O
: O
" O
This O

this O

calling O

" O
Coming O
around O
the O
great O
mass O
of O
the O
Chateau B-LOCATION
Laurier I-LOCATION
, O
he O
braked O
to O
a O
screeching O
stop O
. O

A O
flying O
saucer O
was O
tilting O
and O
dipping O
over O
the O
War B-LOCATION
Memorial I-LOCATION
. O

There O
was O
a O
deep O
whirring O
sound O
, O
and O
a O
high-pitched O
hissing O
overtone O
that O
sang O
in O
his O
ears O
with O
an O
almost O
painful O
sharpness O
. O

He O
reversed O
and O
turned O
back O
on O
McKenzie B-LOCATION
Avenue I-LOCATION
. O

" O
The O
Thetans B-NORP
, O
" O
he O
said O
, O
" O
are O
presumably O
here O
to O
take O
charge O
, O
as O
it O
were O
, O
of O
the O
minds O
of O
the O
people O
- O
who O
are O
probably O
falling O
all O
over O
them- O
selves O
in O
their O
zeal O
to O
get O
their O
orders O
and O
to O
carry O
them O
out O
. O

Just O
what O
these O
orders O
will O
be O
, O
we O
don't O
know O
. O

Now O
, O
because O
of O
prior O
hypnosis O
we O
have O
es- O
caped O
Thetan B-LOCATION
subjugation O
. O

This O
time O
. O

But O
we O
no O
longer O
have O
any O
immunity O
. O

There O
can O
be O
little O
doubt O
that O
if O
the O
Thetans B-NORP
discover O
our O
mental O
independence O
they O
will O
promptly O
give O
us O
their O
hypnotic O
treatment O
. O

If O
we O
can O
avoid O
undue O
prominence O
, O
it O
may O
be O
that O
we O
can O
move O
about O
pretty O
freely O
without O
detection O
. O

If O
we O
can O
- O
well O
, O
then O
we O
may O
be O
able O
to O
promote O
our O
own O
interests O
. O

What O
those O
interests O
are O
, O
beyond O
personal O
security O
, O
I O
haven't O
a O
clue O
; O
but O
, O
who O
knows O
, O
we O
may O
form O
the O
nucleus O
around O
... O
There O
is O
just O
a O
hope O
that O
we O
may O
uncover O
some O
weakness O
, O
and O
find O
a O
way O
of O
fighting O
back O
at O
them O
. O

" O
Heather B-PERSON
agreed O
, O
and O
suggested O
that O
they O
use O
Dan B-PERSON
as O
a O
specimen O
demonstra- O
ting O
how O
the O
Thetan B-LOCATION
machinations O
had O
been O
working O
out O
. O

It O
occurred O
to O
Steve B-PERSON
that O
this O
may O
not O
have O
been O
entirely O
an O
objective O
suggestion O
on O
her O
part O
; O
but O
he O
thought O
it O
a O
good O
idea O
nevertheless O
. O

So O
they O
proceeded O
to O
see O
if O
the O
coast O
was O
clear O
. O

The O
street O
was O
quiet O
and O
deserted O
, O
and O
there O
were O
neither O
sight O
nor O
sound O
of O
flying O
saucers O
. O

So O
they O
ventured O
forth O
and O
made O
their O
way O
on O
foot O
to O
Dan's B-PERSON
house O
. O

Dan B-PERSON
came O
to O
the O
door O
at O
their O
ring O
but O
neglected O
to O
offer O
any O
greeting O
. O

He O
was O
deeply O
preoccupied O
, O
and O
it O
seemed O
that O
the O
ringing O
of O
a O
doorbell O
was O
to O
him O
a O
new O
and O
strange O
phenomenon O
. O

When O
he O
finally O
beckoned O
to O
them O
to O
enter O
, O
the O
action O
gave O
the O
impression O
of O
having O
been O
thought O
out O
and O
decided O
upon O
. O

Inside O
they O
sat O
down O
unbidden O
, O
while O
Dan B-PERSON
paced O
the O
floor O
. O

He O
seemed O
completely O
unaware O
of O
their O
presence O
. O

They O
just O
stared O
at O
him O
, O
turning O
their O
heads O
like O
tennis O
spectators O
as O
he O
walked O
up O
and O
down O
, O
up O
and O
down O
. O

His O
whole O
attitude O
was O
a O
mixture O
of O
impatience O
pending O
an O
awaited O
communication O
and O
of O
a O
vague O
perplexity O
respecting O
his O
surroundings O
and O
the O
purpose O
he O
was O
to O
serve O
. O

Finally O
, O
being O
so O
obviously O
on O
their O
own O
, O
Heather B-PERSON
and O
Steve B-PERSON
tried O
to O
make O
themselves O
at O
home O
. O

Steve B-PERSON
switched O
on O
Dan's B-PERSON
powerful O
, O
world-wide O
radio O
and O
systematically O
turned O
the O
tuning O
knob O
through O
all O
the O
tuning O
points O
of O
the O
world's O
great O
radio O
They O
followed O
him O
to O
a O
city O
bus O
stop O
on O
Carling B-LOCATION
Avenue I-LOCATION
, O
where O
he O
waited O
. O

The O
bus O
stop O
was O
a O
deserted O
island O
on O
an O
empty O
street O
. O

But O
not O
for O
long O
, O
for O
soon O
pedestrians O
and O
cars O
flocked O
upon O
the O
Avenue B-LOCATION
from O
its O
many O
tributary O
streets O
. O

It O
might O
have O
been O
a O
normal O
business-day O
bustle O
, O
except O
for O
two B-CARDINAL
anomalies O
. O

First B-CARDINAL
, O
it O
was O
Sunday B-TIME
morning I-TIME
; O
and O
, O
second B-CARDINAL
, O
everyone O
walked O
, O
or O
drove O
, O
or O
waited O
as O
a O
person O
possessed O
of O
a O
single O
all-exclusive O
purpose O
. O

Then O
he O
would O
go O
back O
to O
Plato B-LOCATION
for O
a O
final O
spell O
of O
real O
days O
and O
would O
return O
to O
New B-LOCATION
York I-LOCATION
in O
late B-TIME
January I-TIME
or O
early B-TIME
February I-TIME
. O

Angelina B-PERSON
might O
be O
a O
little O
sorry O
if O
we O
were O
not O
back O
for O
Christmas B-TIME
as O
arranged O
, O
but O
he O
consoled O
himself O
by O
thinking O
that O
he O
and O
Angelina B-PERSON
would O
have O
plenty O
of O
time O
together O
in O
the O
future O
. O

And O
Heaven O
alone O
knew O
when O
, O
if O
ever O
, O
he O
would O
be O
back O
on O
Moon B-LOCATION
again O
, O
and O
able O
to O
do O
research O
at O
first B-CARDINAL
hand O
into O
matters O
on O
which O
the O
future O
of O
everyone O
, O
including O
Angelina B-PERSON

depended O
... O

on O
the O

so O
, O

not O

" O

All B-PERSON

excited O
at O
the O
time O
, O
not O
by O
the O
prospect O
of O
the O
U.S. B-LOCATION

visit O
, O
but O
by O
a O
great O
storm O
in O
the O
photo- O
sphere O
of O
the O
sun B-LOCATION
. O

A O
matter O
which O
on O
Earth B-LOCATION
would O
hardly O
penetrate O
beyond O
the O
minds O
of O
astronomers O
was O
of O
general O
interest O
to O
the O
Mos B-ORGANIZATION
, O
doubtless O
because O
their O
habitat O
is O
not O
submerged O
beneath O
a O
deep O
natural O
atmosphere O
. O

One O
wondered O
if O
this O
greater O
awareness O
of O
the O
physical O
cosmos O
might O
with O
time O
instil O
the O
reverence O
which O
, O
on O
Earth B-LOCATION
, O
nature O
inspires O
, O
especially O
when O
one O
reflected O
that O
the O
rockets O
over O

Mr. O
Peron's B-PERSON
Board B-ORGANIZATION
presided O
had O
it O
in O
their O

permanently O

enough O
, O
such O
ultimate O

not O

but O
it O
seemed O
very O
probable O
that O
they O
would O
be O
in O
the O
next O

her O

Lester B-PERSON
was O
not O

from O
his O
formidable O

his O

in O
the O

out O

as O
Mr. O

to O
have O
the O
same O
adolescent O
openness O
and O
freshness O
, O
though O
perhaps O
not O
the O
same O
maturity O

One O
remembered O
that O
he O
was O
a O
lawyer O
by O
training O
, O
and O
suspected O
that O
the O
points O
he O
made O
so O
sharply O
in O
international O
politics O
were O
as O
abstract O
to O
him O
as O
those O
a O
lawyer O
makes O
in O
a O
court O
of O
law O
. O

The O
political O
life O
of O
Aristotle B-PERSON
looked O
more O
and O
more O
like O
a O
masquerade O
of O
business O
interests O
in O
dis- O
guise O
which O
, O
far O
from O
attracting O
the O
allegiance O
of O
free O
men O
everywhere O
, O
could O
only O
repel O
them O
. O

Then O
what O
of O
the O
cultural O
life O
? O

Did O
this O
per- O
haps O
nurture O
a O
genuinely O
civilizing O
impulse O
which O
might O
in O
time O
become O
social O
fact O
and O
counteract O
the O
obsession O
with O
economics O
which O
had O
grown O
up O
during O
the O
Moon's B-LOCATION
first B-CARDINAL
two B-TIME
centuries I-TIME
? O

Stepping O
out O
in O
their O
white O
shorts O
, O
they O
looked O
glad O
enough O
to O
be O
diverted O
, O
however O
, O
with O
the O
single O
exception O
of O
one O
worried O
little O
man-student O
who O
kept O
getting O
out O
of O
step O
. O

He O
looked O
as O
if O
nothing O
Moke B-PERSON
and O
his O
minions O
could O
do O
to O
him O
would O
ever O
make O
him O
GO O
; O
but O
the O
reason O
probably O
lay O
in O
elementary O
neurosis O
and O
not O
in O
some O
eruption O
from O
those O
deeper O
layers O
in O
the O
human O
psyche O
which O
are O
trans-economic O
. O

So O
once O
again O
the O
metaphysics O
were O
depressing O
, O
and O
in O
absolute O
contrast O
to O
the O
physical O
display O

If O

a O

... O
' O
Sally B-PERSON
and O
of O

Mrs O

, O
for O
surely O
Mr O
Septimus B-PERSON
stood O
in O
the O
same O
case O
as O
myself O
? O

But O
was O
it O
so O
? O

I O
allowed O
myself O
to O
entertain O
for O
an O
instant O
the O
idea O
, O
the O
strange O
, O
the O
unwelcome O
, O
the O
almost O
inconceivable O
idea O
, O
that O
Ariadne's B-PERSON
arrival O
would O
be O
inopportune O
; O
and O
with O
the O
idea O
came O
a O
somewhat O
vulgar O
impulse O
, O
which O
I O
refused O
, O
to O
watch O
Mr O

more O
closely O
, O
Mrs O

Mr O

would O
... O
But O
all O
three B-CARDINAL
were O
to O
the O
casual O
observation O
I O
permitted O
myself O
unruffled O
; O
Mr O
Septimus B-PERSON
reserved O
and O
certainly O
very O
thoughtful O
, O
but O
that O
was O
his O
habit O
. O

Indeed O
we O
were O
all O
invaded O
by O
a O
most O
tranquil O
mood O
. O

Even O
the O
Indian B-NORP
servants O
relaxed O
, O
knowing O
, O
so O
Mr O
Gilberto B-PERSON
told O
us O
, O
that O
the O
wild O
and O
savage O
tribes O
never O
approached O
this O
region O
: O
at O
any O
rate O
they O
remained O
with O
us O
, O
perhaps O
for O
such O
protection O
as O
our O
presence O
, O
or O
Mrs O
But O
after O
what O
Mrs O
Caine B-PERSON
had O
said O
it O
was O
never O
far O
from O
our O
minds O
that O
at O
any O
moment O
we O
were O
to O
receive O
a O
summons O
. O

I O
could O
see O
that O
Mr O
Septimus B-PERSON
was O
impatient O
for O
it O
. O

This B-TIME
afternoon I-TIME
, O
then O
, O
we O
climbed O
a O
promontory O
, O
a O
mass O
of O
clean O
rock O
crowned O
with O
trees O
and O
bushes O
, O
that O
stood O
well O
out O
over O
the O

" O
Good-bye O

Morfydd B-PERSON

smiling O
from O
the O
bottom O

" O
Good-bye O
, O
Morfydd B-PERSON

" O
He O
sought O
to O
enfold O
her O
in O
his O

But O
he O
was O
too O
late O
. O

She O
was O
already O
up O
the O

the O

heart O
that O
Morfydd B-PERSON
was O
leaving O
him O
as O
surely O
as O
she O
was O
leaving O
Dinas B-LOCATION

So O
the O

set O
out O
for O

But O
it O
never O

Somewhere O

on O

The O

For O
the O

carried O

for O
him O
, O
a O

more O
precious O

Though O
Mofydd B-PERSON

as O
he O
feared O

departed O
out O

Already O

even O
as O
with O

fastened O

But O
even O
his O

luckily O
for O
him O
, O
did O
not O
visualise O
the O
awful O
truth O

that O
Morfyyd B-PERSON

inquired O
little O
Cadwallader B-PERSON
when O
his O

grasped O
the O
fact O
that O

Where O
indeed O
? O

Megan B-PERSON
Thomas I-PERSON
spoke O
sharply O
to O
the O

, O
demanding O
an O
explanation O
. O

But O
nonplussed O
, O
the O

was O
. O

A O
good O

knew O
his O

Fingered O

Peered O

consulted O
the O

echoed O
Cadwallader B-PERSON

" O
Damned O

said O
the O

" O

something O

" O
Immersed O
in O

was O
the O
Rev. O

Now O
he O
put O
down O
his O
paper O

folded O
it O
, O
and O
glanced O
idly O
out O
of O
the O

Looked O
again O

starting O
from O
his O

" O
God O

cried O

" O

tartly O

" O

Mr. O

" O
Morfydd B-PERSON
Owen I-PERSON
was O
silent O
. O

But O
she O
looked O
down O
at O
the O
fast-disappearing O

, O
and O
it O
seemed O
to O
her O
that O
she O
would O
never O
see O
her O

And O
though O
half B-TIME
an I-TIME

she O
had O
regarded O
this O
possibility O
with O
fortitude O
, O
it O
now O
filled O
her O
with O
dismay O
. O

Quietly O
she O
began O
to O
weep O

Dai B-PERSON
, O
meanwhile O
, O
was O
pedalling O
furiously O
on O
the O

Not O
a O

passed O
The B-LOCATION

At O
last O
he O
caught O
up O
Mr. O

walking O
very O
dogged O
towards O

" O

Mr. O

he O
called O

His O
spirits O
were O
rising O

He O
had O
seen O
no O

Therefore O
Mr. O

He O
would O
find O
the O

his O

quietly O

up O

Getting O

The O

switched O
on O

The O
Rev. O

, O
standing O
at O
the O

, O
looked O
at O

forlorn O
flock O
. O

" O
What O
about O
a O
verse O
or O
two B-CARDINAL

Cwm O
Rhondda O
? O

" O
he O
suggested O
hopefully O
. O

They O
looked O
at O
him O
, O
sullen O
. O

His O
heart O
sank O
. O

If O
the O
Welsh B-NORP
found O
the O
situation O
too O
desperate O
for O
singing O
, O
then O
the O
situation O
, O
he O
realised O
, O
must O
be O
desperate O
indeed O
. O

But O
suddenly O
they O
were O
roused O
from O
their O
lethargy O
. O

Something O
was O
approaching O
, O
faster O
, O
faster O
, O
a O
tearing O
hurrying O
blur O
that O
was O
past O
and O
gone O
in O
a O
moment O
, O
followed O
by O
a O
great O
rush O
of O
sound O
. O

They O
waved O
frantically O
. O

" O
Do O
as O
I O
say O
, O

. O

" O
Very O
stern O
, O
the O

So O
the O

peep-peeped O
as O
through O
empty O
space O
. O

" O
Thank O

" O
the O

were O
many O
events O

Chief O
of O
these O
was O
that O

learned O

properly O

The O
pains O
associated O

soon O
died O
away O

an O

the O
ugly O
flopping O
movements O
of O

had O
no O

Alastair B-PERSON
was O
a O
bachelor O
. O

All O
his O
life O
he O
had O
been O
inclined O
to O
regard O
women O
as O
something O
which O
must O
necessarily O
be O
subordinated O
to O
his O
career O
. O

Now O
he O
realised O
that O
he O
was O
entrusting O
not O
only O
his O
own O
life O
, O
but O
Geoffrey's B-PERSON
as O
well O
, O
to O
a O
strange O
girl O
whom O
he O
had O
never O
met O
and O
on O
whom O
after O
no O
more O
than O
a O
couple O
of O
telephone O
calls O
he O
was O
prepared O
to O
place O
complete O
reliance O
. O

It O
was O
a O
novel O
experience O
. O

Alastair B-PERSON
was O
quite O
unable O
to O
explain O
why O
he O
should O
feel O
so O
much O
confidence O
in O
her O
. O

Once O
again O
she O
checked O
back O
her O
instructions O
. O

It O
was O
obvious O
that O
she O
did O
not O
fail O
to O
appreciate O
the O
faith O
which O
he O
was O
placing O
in O
her O
and O
was O
prepared O
to O
accept O
the O
responsibility O
. O

" O
Good O
luck O
, O
Air O
Marshal O
, O
" O
she O
said O
gently O
. O

" O
I O
'll O
be O
waiting O
for O
you O
at O
the O
Hotel B-LOCATION
Roma I-LOCATION
at O
six B-TIME
this I-TIME
evening I-TIME
- O
and O
I O
shall O
look O
forward O
to O
meeting O
you O
both O
at O
midnight B-TIME
. O

" O
They O
might O
have O
been O
arranging O
a O
supper O
party O
. O

Then O
she O
rang O
off O
. O

Alastair B-PERSON
admitted O
that O
never O
in O
a O
not O
altogether O
uneventful O
life O
had O
he O
come O
across O
a O
girl O
who O
sounded O
so O
charming O
and O
appeared O
to O
be O
so O
efficient O
. O

For O
some O
reason O
the O
orderlies O
had O
forgotten O
to O
switch O
on O
the O
lights O
; O
there O
was O
no O
colour O
- O
physical O
features O
were O
distinguishable O
solely O
by O
gradations O
of O
silvery O
greyness O
. O

Even O
the O
snow- O
capped O
summit O
of O
Mont B-LOCATION
Blanc I-LOCATION
, O
seven B-CARDINAL
miles O
below O
, O
was O
not O
recognisable O
among O
the O
host O
of O
lower O
peaks O
. O

The O
screen O
of O
the O
air-to-air O
radar O
glowed O
. O

Occasionally O
minute O
spots O
flickered O
across O
its O
surface O
, O
but O
there O
was O
no O
permanent O
image O
. O

In O
the O
exceptional O
clarity O
he O
was O
even O
able O
to O
make O
a O
direct O
comparison O
between O
the O
radar O
image O
and O
the O
ground O
itself O
. O

Ahead O
lay O
the O
Plain B-LOCATION
of I-LOCATION
Lombardy I-LOCATION
; O
to O
the O
right O
, O
Turin B-LOCATION
; O
to O
the O
left O
, O
Milan B-LOCATION
. O

The O
directional O
angle O
of O
the O
scanner O
could O
be O
adjusted O
to O
cover O
any O
particular O
area O
within O
its O
range O
. O

Geoffrey B-PERSON
turned O
the O
scale O
slowly O
to O
cover O
the O
ground O
immediately O
ahead O
. O

He O
was O
able O
to O
pick O
out O
towns O
, O
unrecognisable O
to O
the O
naked O
eye O
, O
obscured O
by O
the O
ground O
haze O
which O
even O
on O
the O
clearest O
night B-TIME
limited O
angular O
vision O
. O

He O
glanced O
at O
the O
speed O
recorder O
. O

It O
seemed O
almost O
incredible O
that O
the O
tiny O
white O
figure O
of O
8.5 B-CARDINAL
against O
which O
the O
needle O
was O
resting O
could O
really O
mean O
hundreds B-CARDINAL
of O
knots O
. O

Now O
, O
as O
Alastair B-PERSON
reduced O
the O
thrust O
, O
the O
pitch O
changed O
as O
the O
nose O
of O
the O
aircraft O
dipped O
slightly O
. O

The O
needle O
of O
the O
speed O
recorder O
swung O
gently O
through O
8.0 B-CARDINAL
, O
7.0 B-CARDINAL
, O
6.0 B-CARDINAL
before O
coming O
to O
rest O
at O
5.0 B-CARDINAL
. O

" O
We O
're O
a O
bit O
ahead O
of O
time O
, O
" O
said O
Alastair B-PERSON
. O

" O
We O
'll O
run O
in O
on O
minimum O
engine O
power O
. O

" O
Geoffrey B-PERSON
smiled O
. O

Alastair B-PERSON
talked O
of O
running O
in O
when O
they O
were O
still O
more B-CARDINAL
than I-CARDINAL
four I-CARDINAL
hundred I-CARDINAL
miles O
from O
their O
destination O
. O

They O
were O
nearing O
Modena B-LOCATION
. O

Geoffrey B-PERSON
focused O
the O
radar O
scanner O
on O
the O
bridge O
over O
the O
Po B-LOCATION
, O
barely B-CARDINAL
forty I-CARDINAL
miles O
to O
port O
. O

He O
was O
able O
to O
trace O
the O
course O
of O
the O
river O
; O
he O
thought O
he O
could O
recognise O
the O
route O
of O
N12 B-LOCATION
, O
along O
which O
he O
had O
motored O
so O
desperately O
little B-TIME
more I-TIME
than I-TIME
twenty-four I-TIME
hours I-TIME
earlier O
. O

Since O
then O
he O
had O
flown O
to O
England B-LOCATION
, O
attended O
the O
vital O
conference O
in O
Bruce B-PERSON
Denton's I-PERSON
office O
, O
been O
whisked O
by O
special O
helicopter O
from O
the O
Horse B-LOCATION
Guards I-LOCATION
Parade I-LOCATION
to O
Boscombe B-LOCATION
Down I-LOCATION
, O
slept O
for O
six B-TIME
blessed I-TIME
refreshing I-TIME
hours I-TIME
and O
had O
now O
completed O
two-thirds B-CARDINAL
of O
the O
journey O
back O
to O
the O
place O
where O
every O
indication O
pointed O
to O
Eve B-PERSON
being O
held O
. O

Geoffrey B-PERSON
set O
himself O
to O
consider O
the O
movements O
of O
the O
Bentley O
. O

It O
had O
passed O
him O
at O
the O
temporary O
bridge O
over O
the O
Tartaro B-LOCATION
at O
a B-TIME
few I-TIME
minutes I-TIME
past I-TIME
ten I-TIME
on O
the B-TIME
previous I-TIME
night I-TIME
. O

He O
worked O
out O
the O
distance O
on O
the O
presumption O
that O
its O
route O
had O
been O
through O
Florence B-LOCATION
and O
Rome B-LOCATION
and O
then O
across O
Italy B-LOCATION
via O
Foggia B-LOCATION
to O
Barletta B-LOCATION
. O

It O
came O
to O
just B-CARDINAL
over I-CARDINAL
six I-CARDINAL
hundred I-CARDINAL
miles O
. O

To O
Beryl B-PERSON
, O
at O
least O
, O
this O
was O
anti-climax O
with O
a O
vengeance O
. O

She O
had O
expected O
to O
be O
met O
with O
violent O
reproaches O
- O
and O
here O
he O
was O
bland O
and O
smiling O
. O

But O
it O
did O
not O
take O
her O
long O
to O
realise O
that O
his O
mood O
was O
less O
pleasant O
than O
appeared O
on O
the O
surface O
. O

He O
told O
her O
nonchalantly O
, O
as O
he O
led O
the O
way O
to O
his O
own O
veranda O
, O
that O
he O
had O
taken O
the O
liberty O
of O
asking O
Jack B-PERSON
- O
as O
a O
representative O
of O
the O
Vallin B-PERSON
family O
- O
to O
come O
over O
and O
make O
the O
presentation O
in O
her O
stead O
. O

" O
I O
caught O
him O
just O
as O
he O
was O
going O
to O
the O
airport O
to O
meet O
Blanche B-PERSON
, O
" O
he O
said O
. O

" O
As O
a O
matter O
of O
fact O
I O
'd O
asked O
him O
last B-TIME
night I-TIME
to O
deputise O
for O
me O
and O
fetch O
her O
. O

He O
brought O
her O
to O
the O
party O
too O
. O

They O
're O
both O
here O
. O

" O
" O
I O
didn't O
know O
she O
was O
coming O
back O
from O
Barbados B-LOCATION
so O
soon O
. O

" O
Beryl B-PERSON
said O
the O
first B-CARDINAL
thing O
that O
came O
into O
her O
head O
. O

Jack B-PERSON
and O
Blanche B-PERSON
were O
quick O
to O
sympathise O
, O
and O
to O
express O
their O
disgust O
at O
Sir O
John's B-PERSON
abominable O
treatment O
of O
his O
guests O
. O

But O
Piers B-PERSON
remained O
aloof O
, O
and O
when O
Beryl B-PERSON
suggested O
having O
a O
second B-CARDINAL
party O
, O
the B-TIME
following I-TIME
week I-TIME
, O
he O
poured O
cold O
water O
on O
the O
project O
. O

Everyone O
, O
he O
declared O
, O
had O
had O
a O
thoroughly O
good O
time O
, O
and O
it O
would O
take O
them O
nearly O
to O
next B-TIME
week I-TIME
to O
settle O
down O
again O
. O

Meanwhile O
Hubert B-PERSON
would O
have O
betaken O
himself O
and O
his O
well- O
earned O
gratuity O
to O
his O
native O
village O
at O
the O
north O
of O
the O
island O
. O

It O
was O
all O
over O
and O
done O
with O
. O

For O
the O
time O
being O
Beryl B-PERSON
was O
content O
to O
let O
it O
go O
at O
that O
, O
but O
she O
resolved O
to O
have O
it O
out O
with O
Piers B-PERSON
when O
a O
reasonable O
opportunity O
presented O
itself O
. O

He O
must O
learn O
that O
he O
could O
not O
treat O
her O
with O
injustice O
and O
contempt O
, O
ignoring O
her O
explanations O
as O
though O
he O
were O
a O
schoolmaster O
and O
she O
a O
small O
, O
ignorant O
child O
. O

He O
gave O
her O
no O
chance O
of O
any O
private O
conversation O
that B-TIME
evening I-TIME
, O
for O
when O
Blanche B-PERSON
and O
Jack B-PERSON
left O
, O
he O
went O
with O
them O
. O

But O
next B-TIME
morning I-TIME
she O
insisted O
on O
his O
taking O
her O
out O
in O
the O
jeep O
- O
to O
find O
, O
if O
possible O
, O
Hubert B-PERSON
and O
his O
relations O
, O
and O
tell O
them O
of O
her O
great O
disappointment O
at O
being O
held O
up O
in O
Balicou B-LOCATION
. O

With O
an O
air O
of O
resignation O
he O
sent O
Judy B-PERSON
, O
his O
Boxer O
, O
to O
the O
back O
, O
and O
made O
room O
for O
her O
beside O
him O
. O

" O
Is O
that O
all O
you O
want O
to O
do O
? O

" O
he O
asked O
, O
letting O
in O
the O
clutch O
. O

" O
No O
; O
I O
want O
to O
make O
you O
understand O
just O
what O
happened O
about O
this O
Balicou B-LOCATION
trip O
, O
" O
she O
returned O
coldly O
. O

" O
I O
'm O
a O
little O
tired O
of O
being O
treated O
like O
an O
ineffective O
imbecile O
. O

" O
" O
And O
I O
'm O
heartily O
sick O
of O
being O
constantly O
called O
to O
account O
for O
my O
manners O
, O
" O
he O
retorted O
. O

" O
What O
have O
I O
done O
wrong O
now O
? O

I O
cover O
up O
for O
you O
the O
best O
way O
I O
can O
by O
getting O
hold O
of O
Jack B-PERSON
to O
make O
the O
presentation O
, O
I O
run O
the O
damned O
party O
to O
the O
best O
of O
my O
ability O
- O
saying O
the O
sugary O
things O
you O
ought O
to O
have O
been O
there O
to O
say O
- O
and O
all O
you O
can O
do O
is O
to O
find O
fault O
. O

" O
" O
It O
's O
your O
superior O
attitude O
that O
riles O
me O
. O

" O
Beryl B-PERSON
was O
scarlet O
with O
annoyance O
. O

" O
How O
I O
happened O
to O
be O
marooned O
at O
Balicou B-LOCATION
doesn't O
interest O
you O
in O
the O
faintest O
degree O
. O

You O
look O
as O
though O
it O
was O
only O
what O
you O
expected O
of O
me O
, O
as O
though O
I O
didn't O
care O
a O
hoot O
about O
letting O
Hubert B-PERSON
and O
his O
pals O
down O
. O

" O
" O
As O
your O
employee O
it O
's O
not O
my O
business O
to O
understand O
all O
the O
whys O
and O
wherefores O
of O
your O
actions O
, O
" O
he O
said O
stiffly O
. O

" O
Still O
less O
to O
criticise O
you O
. O

" O
" O
Oh O
, O
drop O
that O
nonsense O
, O
Piers B-PERSON
! O

Be O
yourself O
, O
" O
she O
exclaimed O
, O
with O
mounting O
exasperation O
. O

" O
Very O
well O
! O

" O
He O
brought O
the O
jeep O
to O
a O
standstill O
in O
a O
rough O
path O
fringed O
and O
shaded O
by O
citrus O
trees O
. O

" O
If O
you O
want O
my O
true O
opinion O
I O
'll O
give O
it O
. O

You O
made O
some O
sort O
of O
a O
protest O
to O
Graybury B-ORGANIZATION
. O

I O
'll O
give O
you O
credit O
for O
that O
. O

But O
you O
didn't O
press O
the O
matter O
because O
, O
very O
naturally O
, O
you O
were O
thoroughly O
enjoying O
Forrest's B-PERSON
company O
in O
idyllic O
surroundings O
. O

" O
" O
How O
dare O
you O
say O
such O
a O
thing O
? O

" O
she O
blazed O
. O

" O
For O
goodness' O
sake O
show O
a O
glimmer O
of O
reason O
, O
" O
was O
his O
equally O
indignant O
rejoinder O
. O

" O
I O
know O
. O

Absurd O
as O
it O
may O
seem O
, O
I O
didn't O
want O
you O
to O
think O
badly O
of O
me O
. O

" O
She O
turned O
away O
from O
him O
to O
fondle O
Judy B-PERSON
, O
who O
, O
sensing O
something O
amiss O
, O
was O
nudging O
her O
in O
the O
endeavour O
to O
gain O
her O
attention O
. O

" O
The O
truth O
is O
that O
if O
I O
had O
absolutely O
insisted O
on O
sailing O
at O
the O
time O
originally O
arranged O
, O
Sir O
John B-PERSON
would O
have O
had O
it O
in O
for O
Guy B-PERSON
. O

You O
see O
, O
it O
was O
, O
apparently O
, O
through O
a O
mistake O
on O
Guy's B-PERSON
part O
that O
we O
missed O
seeing O
the O
flamingoes O
our O
first B-CARDINAL
morning B-TIME
on O
the O
island O
. O

" O
" O
What O
harm O
could O
possibly O
have O
come O
to O
Forrest B-PERSON
through O
Sir O
John's B-PERSON
nonsense O
? O

" O
Piers B-PERSON
could O
hardly O
have O
spoken O
with O
more O
contempt O
. O

A O
bully O
like O
that O
respects O
anyone O
who O
dares O
to O
stand O
up O
to O
him O
. O

" O
Beryl B-PERSON
tried O
to O
suppress O
the O
thought O
that O
this O
was O
precisely O
the O
remark O
she O
had O
made O
to O
Guy B-PERSON
. O

She O
said O
icily O
, O
" O
As O
you O
pride O
yourself O
on O
your O
knowledge O
of O
all O
the O
affairs O
of O
the O
island O
I O
needn't O
tell O
you O
that O
Sir O
John B-PERSON
Graybury I-PERSON
is O
one O
of O
Mr. O
Hewson's B-PERSON
most O
important O
customers O
. O

" O
" O
So O
what O
? O

You O
're O
not O
trying O
to O
say O
that O
Hewson B-PERSON
would O
victimise O
Forrest B-PERSON
for O
behaving O
with O
ordinary O
moral O
courage O
! O

He O
's O
quite O
capable O
of O
telling O
Sir O
John B-PERSON
to O
take O
himself O
and O
his O
business O
to O
an O
unmention- O
able O
destination O
. O

" O
" O
There O
's O
a O
difference O
between O
what O
a O
senior O
and O
a O
junior O
partner O
can O
do O
, O
" O
was O
her O
quick O
reply O
. O

" O
What O
they O
can O
bring O
off O
! O

I O
'll O
admit O
that O
. O

But O
Forrest B-PERSON
might O
at O
least O
have O
tried O
. O

He O
's O
pretty O
spineless O
! O

" O
" O
You O
think O
you O
could O
have O
carried O
more O
weight O
with O
Sir O
John B-PERSON
? O

" O
she O
enquired O
cuttingly O
. O

" O
For O
all O
your O
good O
opinion O
of O
yourself O
, O
I O
doubt O
it O
. O

He O
's O
about O
as O
easy O
to O
push O
around O
as O
- O
as O
a O
grounded O
whale O
! O

" O
He O
had O
to O
smile O
at O
that O
, O
but O
went O
on O
airily O
, O
" O
I O
'd O
have O
made O
an O
attempt O
to O
show O
my O
lady-love O
that O
I O
put O
her O
interests O
before O
my O

Their O
air O
of O

them O

at O

, O
and O
their O
friendly O
welcome O

warm O

as O
she O
explained O
how O
she O
had O

to O
miss O
the O
party O
, O
made O
her O
send O
a O
complacent O
glance O
in O
Piers' B-PERSON
direction O
. O

What O
a O
fuss-box O
the O
man O
was O
, O
she O
thought O
impatiently O
, O
trying O
to O
worry O
her O
into O
the O
belief O
that O
her O
failure O
to O
appear O
at O
a O
function O
on O
the O
estate O
was O
a O
major O
error O
: O
And O
then O
she O
received O
a O
jolt O

standing O

his O

rounded O

a O

Seaweed's B-PERSON
memory O
was O
prodigious O

her O

She O
greeted O
John B-PERSON

however O
, O
with O
less O

her O

flashed O
a O

Evidently O
the O

not O

to O
Fleet B-LOCATION
Street I-LOCATION

" O
asked O
Bawley B-PERSON
. O

" O
You O
should O
. O

Next O
time O
you O
're O
in O
Town O
give O
me O
a O
ring O
at O
this O
number O
and O
I O
'll O
take O
you O
round O
the O
pubs O
where O
most O
of O
the O
work O
is O
done O
. O

" O
He O
held O
out O
a O
card O
. O

John B-PERSON
took O
it O
and O
put O
it O
in O
his O
pocket O
. O

" O
Thanks O
, O
" O
he O
said O
. O

" O
If O
ever O
my O
missus O
lets O
me O
off O
the O
chain O
I O
'll O
take O
you O
up O
on O
that O
. O

Glad O
I O
met O
you O
. O

Don't O
forget O
to O
give O
me O
a O
ring O
- O
any O
time O
- O
knock O
twice O
and O
ask O
for O
Bawley B-PERSON
, O
what O
? O

" O
" O
I O
don't O
know O
when O
that O
will O
be O
, O
" O
said O
John B-PERSON
. O

" O
I O
shall O
be O
busy O
for O
a O
while O
, O
cleaning O
up O
after O
Master O
bloody O
Munyard B-PERSON
. O

" O
THERE O
were O
six B-CARDINAL
submarines O
, O
lying O
in O
pairs O
alongside O
the O
jetty O
at O
Fort B-LOCATION
Blockhouse I-LOCATION
. O

Black O
and O
grimly O
businesslike O
they O
both O
looked O
and O
sounded O
, O
for O
all O
of O
them O
were O
rumbling O
as O
they O
charged O
their O
electric O
batteries O
. O

A O
light O
wind O
wafted O
the O
smoke O
of O
diesel O
exhaust O
in O
through O
the O
open O
windows O
of O
the O
Captain's O
house O
. O

It O
pervaded O
every O
room O
but O
neither O
Harry B-PERSON
nor O
Madeleine B-PERSON
Turton I-PERSON
noticed O
its O
existence O
as O
they O
sat O
in O
silence O
over O
a O
substantial O
breakfast O
. O

Although O
usually O
a O
very O
talkative O
lady O
Madeleine B-PERSON
respected O
her O
husband's O
silences O
, O
for O
she O
knew O
they O
betokened O
a O
worry O
of O
some O
sort O
. O

There O
had O
been O
many O
such O
breakfasts O
lately O
since O
the O
affair O
of O
Parsifal B-PERSON
. O

Harry B-PERSON
had O
lost O
a O
good O
deal O
of O
weight O
. O

His O
normal O
placid O
and O
steady-going O
manner O
remained O
, O
but O
she O
could O
see O
that O
it O
no O
longer O
came O
naturally O
. O

It O
is O
the O
common O
lot O
of O
all O
Squadron O
Senior O
Officers O
to O
experience O
such O
catastrophes O
as O
the O
loss O
of O
a O
submarine O
, O
though O
in O
peace O
time O
these O
happenings O
are O
few O
and O
far O
between O
. O

This O
is O
the O
testing O
time O
for O
all O
. O

The O
affair O
blows O
up O
into O
a O
national O
disaster O
and O
then O
when O
it O
is O
all O
over O
life O
must O
continue O
as O
before O
. O

During O
this O
period O
the O
Captain O
must O
present O
an O
unruffled O
appearance O
and O
carry O
on O
as O
if O
nothing O
unusual O
has O
happened O
. O

Harry B-PERSON
Turton I-PERSON
had O
written O
letters O
to O
the O
bereaved O
, O
had O
visited O
many O
in O
the O
locality O
, O
had O
been O
interviewed O
by O
the O
Press O
, O
had O
driven O
his O
surviving O
submarines O
a O
good O
deal O
harder O
than O
usual O
and O
in O
fact O
had O
applied O
all O
the O
usual O
specifics O
suitable O
for O
such O
occasions O
. O

He O
rode O
down O
to O
where O
I O
was O
waiting O
. O

I O
was O
thinking O
what O
a O
skill O
he O
had O
for O
reading O
my O
mind O
. O

" O
This O
would O
be O
as O
good O
a O
place O
for O
a O
hold-up O
as O
any O
, O
" O
he O
said O
, O
reining O
in O
near O
me O
. O

" O
Yes O
, O
" O
I O
said O
. O

" O
It O
'll O
be O
here O
to- B-TIME
morrow I-TIME
as O
likely O
as O
not O
. O

" O
I O
paused O
. O

" O
Miss O
Jeannie B-PERSON
'll O
be O
on O
that O
coach O
, O
Dan B-PERSON
. O

" O
" O
Yes O
, O
" O
he O
said O
. O

" O
I O
know O
. O

" O
" O
No O
harm O
must O
come O
to O
her O
, O
Dan B-PERSON
. O

" O
" O
She O
'll O
be O
all O
right O
. O

It O
's O
the O
men O
who O
'll O
be O
after O
that O
coach O
I O
'm O
interested O
in O
, O
Johnny B-PERSON
. O

" O
" O
I O
know O
. O

But O
if O
lead O
starts O
flying O
she O
might O
be O
in O
danger O
. O

" O
" O
That O
's O
so O
. O

But O
I O
reckon O
they O
'll O
be O
too O
busy O
shooting O
at O
us O
to O
bother O
with O
the O
coach O
and O
the O
folks O
in O
it O
. O

" O
" O
Maybe O
, O
" O
I O
said O
. O

" O
But O
we O
've O
got O
to O
remember O
that O
girl O
all O
the O
time O
, O
Dan B-PERSON
. O

I O
feel O
kind O
of O
responsible O
for O
her O
. O

" O
" O
Of O
course O
, O
" O
he O
said O
, O
giving O
me O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
his O
strange O
looks O
. O

Then O
he O
turned O
the O
conversation O
. O

" O
Let O
's O
ride O
over O
and O
have O
a O
look O
at O
the O
mining O
camp O
. O

After O
all O
it O
's O
them O
we O
're O
supposed O
to O
be O
working O
for O
, O
as O
well O
as O
the O
townsfolk O
and O
the O
agency O
detective O
. O

" O
With O
something O
of O
a O
start O
I O
remembered O
the O
man O
who O
'd O
brought O
us O
into O
this O
business O
. O

" O
Maybe O
you O
don't O
know O
about O
Appleton B-PERSON
, O
Dan B-PERSON
? O

" O
" O
Know O
what O
? O

" O
" O
That O
he O
's O
dead O
, O
" O
I O
said O
. O

I O
watched O
him O
because O
I O
was O
always O
fascinated O
by O
the O
way O
he O
looked O
when O
you O
tried O
to O
surprise O
him O
. O

" O
Dead O
? O

" O
he O
said O
. O

" O
Yes O
. O

Dead O
. O

Shuffled O
out O
of O
the O
deck O
. O

Blasted O
down O
with O
a O
shotgun O
outside O
the O
Palace B-LOCATION
last B-TIME
night I-TIME
. O

" O
" O
Fenton B-PERSON
or O
Somers B-PERSON
, O
" O
he O
said O
. O

" O
Or O
the O
Town O
Marshal O
, O
" O
I O
added O
. O

His O
face O
was O
fixed O
, O
unreadable O
as O
a O
rock O
. O

" O
Let O
's O
get O
over O
to O
the O
mining O
camp O
, O
" O
he O
said O
abruptly O
. O

He O
wheeled O
his O
horse O
back O
off O
the O
trail O
and O
up O
the O
slope O
leading O
to O
the O
ridge O
. O

I O
followed O
. O

From O
the O
top O
you O
could O
see O
something O
of O
the O
wild O
hill O
country O
that O
lay O
all O
round O
Gilburg B-LOCATION
Crossing I-LOCATION
. O

The O
air O
was O
fresh O
and O
clear O
and O
you O
could O
see O
far O
over O
west O
and O
north O
for O
many O
miles O
. O

The O
real O
high O
country O
of O
the O
Rockies B-LOCATION
lifted O
up O
in O
the O
distance O
like O
a O
pale O
water- O
colour O
drawing O
. O

Between O
us O
and O
that O
lay O
a O
vast O
stretch O
of O
hills O
, O
canyons O
, O
buttes O
and O
malpais O
. O

" O
The O
mine-workings O
lie O
north O
of O
the O
town O
, O
" O
said O
Dan B-PERSON
. O

" O
If O
we O
head O
west O
we O
ought O
to O
cut O
the O
trail O
leading O
from O
Gilburg B-LOCATION
to O
the O
north O
. O

" O
So O
we O
swung O
west O
, O
making O
slow O
going O
over O
rough O
country O
, O
sliding O
on O
shale O
, O
climbing O
down O
into O
draws O
, O
circling O
a O
big O
mesa O
by O
a O
four B-CARDINAL
or O
five B-CARDINAL
mile O
valley O
, O
sandy-floored O
. O

It O
got O
hotter O
as O
the O
day O
wore O
on O
and O
we O
rested O
gratefully O
by O
a O
small O
creek O
where O
we O
watered O
the O
horses O
and O
drank O
enough O
to O
cure O
our O
thirst O
. O

An O
hour's B-TIME
riding O
brought O
us O
to O
a O
trail O
that O
we O
figured O
would O
lead O
to O
the O
miners' O
camp O
. O

We O
turned O
north O
into O
it O
and O
after O
about B-CARDINAL
four I-CARDINAL
miles O
it O
led O
into O
a O
small O
canyon O
which O
opened O
out O
into O
a O
wide O
shallow O
draw O
. O

Here O
in O
a O
dried-up O
creek-bed O
we O
found O
the O
miners O
at O
work O
. O

They O
were O
scattered O
over O
a O
fairly O
wide O
area O
working O
singly O
or O
in O
pairs O
. O

We O
didn't O
approach O
unchallenged O
. O

Just O
short O
of O
the O
diggings O
there O
was O
a O
roughly-built O
shack O
and O
as O
we O
got O
near O
someone O
inside O
bawled O
out O
, O
" O
If O
you O
come O
any O
closer O
, O
I O
'll O
sure O
blow O
your O
whiskers O
off O
. O

" O
" O
Take O
it O
easy O
, O
mister O
, O
" O
I O
sang O
out O
. O

" O
We O
don't O
aim O
to O
come O
any O
closer O
and O
we O
've O
got O
no O
whiskers O
so O
as O
you O
can O
see O
. O

Just O
you O
go O
and O
tell O
Nick B-PERSON
Dowd I-PERSON
we O
've O
come O
to O
talk O
to O
him O
about O
what O
happened O
last B-TIME
night I-TIME
. O

" O
" O
Oh O
, O
" O
said O
the O
unseen O
guard O
. O

He O
blew O
a O
whistle O
then O
, O
loud O
and O
shrill O
. O

The O
gun O
barrel O
peeking O
out O
through O
a O
hole O
in O
the O
shack O
never O
wavered O
. O

We O
sat O
our O
horses O
, O
waiting O
. O

" O
Looks O
as O
though O
they O
're O
expecting O
trouble O
, O
" O
I O
said O
. O

" O
Where O
there O
's O
gold O
and O
women O
there O
's O
always O
trouble O
, O
" O
observed O
Dan B-PERSON
, O
shifting O
about O
in O
his O
saddle O
. O

He O
was O
never O
long O
on O
patience O
. O

Mr. O
Copthorne B-PERSON
knew O
a O
way O
round O
by O
the O
side O
of O
the O
church O
where O
there O
was O
a O
small O
open O
outbuilding O
where O
the O
grave O
digger O
kept O
his O
spades O
and O
forks O
and O
tidying O
up O
implements O
. O

It O
might O
be O
open O
. O

It O
was O
. O

He O
entered O
, O
and O
seated O
himself O
in O
a O
huddle O
upon O
an O
upturned O
wheelbarrow O
. O

His O
curious O
headgear O
fell O
off O
. O

Strange O
things O
were O
going O
on O
in O
his O
bewildered O
brain O
. O

When O
a O
man O
was O
drowning O
and O
towards O
his O
last O
gasp O
it O
was O
scientifically O
supposed O
his O
whole O
life O
came O
up O
before O
him O
in O
some O
cinematic O
kind O
of O
sequence O
. O

Mr. O
Copthorne B-PERSON
was O
on O
dry O
land O
in O
a O
church O
outbuilding O
, O
but O
this O
was O
happening O
to O
him O
now O
. O

He O
saw O
himself O
as O
a O
sulky O
, O
ugly O
, O
malformed O
, O
repressed O
boy O
, O
then O
a O
young O
youth O
. O

He O
saw O
himself O
refusing O
baptism O
according O
to O
the O
sect O
his O
parents O
belonged O
to O
. O

Walking O
out O
of O
the O
chapel O
later O
on O
. O

Continuing O
on O
, O
his O
leaping O
mind O
flashed O
pictures O
of O
chi- O
canery O
and O
corruption O
, O
the O
growth O
of O
the O
dea- O
dly O
decadence O
and O
absorption O
in O
debase- O
ment O
and O
Satanic O
debauchery O
. O

He O
didn't O
know O
what O
to O
make O
of O
it O
, O
but O
it O
was O
Mr. O
Copthorne B-PERSON
all O
right O
. O

Perhaps O
he O
had O
been O
attending O
some O
kind O
of O
fancy O
dress O
do O
in O
London B-LOCATION
. O

Very O
strange O
his O
eyes O
looked O
. O

Mad O
, O
hunted O
eyes O
, O
as O
if O
the O
poor O
fellow O
had O
rocks O
in O
his O
head O
, O
so O
the O
verger O
described O
afterwards O
. O

" O
You O
're O
very O
early O
about O
, O
sir O
, O
" O
he O
said O
, O
trying O
to O
speak O
normally O
. O

" O
Yes O
. O

I O
travelled O
down O
from O
London B-LOCATION
as O
the O
dawn O
was O
breaking O
, O
and O
the O
thought O
came O
to O
me O
I O
'd O
like O
to O
take O
a O
look O
at O
the O
church O
. O

I O
've O
never O
been O
inside O
. O

Very O
remiss O
of O
me O
, O
" O
said O
Mr. O
Copthorne B-PERSON
. O

The O
verger O
led O
the O
way O
in O
. O

" O
The O
stained O
glass O
windows O
, O
sir O
, O
they O
date O
back O
to O
the B-TIME
fourteenth I-TIME
century I-TIME
. O

" O
There O
were O
few O
passengers O
on O
the O
plane O
and O
Gavin B-PERSON
was O
quickly O
through O
the O
customs O
. O

" O
Gay B-PERSON
! O

" O
" O
Gavin B-PERSON
! O

" O
The O
girl O
and O
her O
luggage O
had O
disappeared O
and O
they O
were O
alone O
together O
. O

The O
porter O
brought O
Gavin's B-PERSON
bag O
out O
to O
the O
taxi O
. O

" O
Just O
a O
moment O
, O
darling O
, O
" O
Gavin B-PERSON
pressed O
her O
hand O
and O
smiled O
. O

" O
I O
want O
to O
check O
up O
on O
the O
flights O
back O
. O

" O
Gay B-PERSON
went O
out O
to O
the O
waiting O
taxi O
, O
and O
then O
found O
that O
in O
the O
excitement O
of O
meeting O
Gavin B-PERSON
she O
had O
left O
her O
sun- O
glasses O
on O
the O
veranda O
. O

She O
went O
quickly O
back O
to O
fetch O
them O
. O

Gavin B-PERSON
and O
the O
girl O
who O
had O
got O
off O
the O
plane O
with O
him O
were O
talking O
. O

He O
was O
writing O
something O
in O
his O
pocket-book O
, O
with O
a O
sick O
feeling O
of O
despair O
Gay B-PERSON
knew O
that O
of O
course O
" O
And O
then O
we O
'll O
go O
for O
a O
stroll O
along O
the O
beach O
. O

A O
moon O
like O
this O
mustn't O
be O
wasted O
. O

" O
He O
gestured O
towards O
the O
bay O
where O
the O
full O
moon O
was O
just O
rising O
over O
the O
rocks O
, O
then O
laid O
his O
hand O
on O
hers O
. O

Gay B-PERSON
smiled O
at O
him O
again O
, O
happy O
beyond O
belief O
, O
knowing O
that O
now O
Gavin B-PERSON
was O
in O
love O
with O
her O
and O
her O
only O
, O
yet O
remembering O
for O
a B-TIME
second I-TIME
the O
kisses O
she O
had O
seen O
him O
giving O
Elaine B-PERSON
. O

All O
that O
was O
part O
of O
the O
past O
, O
she O
would O
put O
it O
behind O
her O
. O

She O
would O
never O
be O
jealous O
again O
, O
would O
even O
take O
Larry's B-PERSON
advice O
and O
look O
the O
other O
way O
if O
need O
be O
. O

" O
I O
say O
! O

" O
Gavin B-PERSON
was O
looking O
over O
her O
shoulder O
. O

" O
That O
's O
a O
pretty O
girl O
! O

" O
Gay B-PERSON
glanced O
behind O
her O
, O
" O
Isn't O
she O
lovely O
, O
she O
's O
French B-NORP
, O
a O
very O
well O
known O
model O
I O
believe O
. O

Gay B-PERSON
, O
a O
little O
puzzled O
, O
went O
through O
to O
the O
bar O
. O

Doc B-PERSON
and O
Lilyan B-PERSON
were O
sitting O
just O
inside O
having O
coffee O
. O

" O

Gay B-PERSON
thanked O
him O

walked O
out O

bought O
a O
drink O

taken O
it O
outside O

She O
looked O
round O

the O

her O
breath O
, O
a O
cold O
hand O
seeming O
to O
clutch O
her O
heart O

Gavin B-PERSON
was O
seated O
at O
a O
small O
table O
in O
a O
shadowy O
corner O
talking O
animatedly O
to O

offered O
the O

a O
cigarette O

lit O
it O
, O
his O

cupping O

in O
an O
intimate O
way O
. O

Gay B-PERSON
stood O
irresolute O
for O
a O
moment O
, O
half B-CARDINAL
decided O
to O
go O
back O

join O
Lilyan B-PERSON

Doc B-PERSON
, O
while O
she O
wanted O
to O
do O
no O
more O
than O
run O
upstairs O
to O
her O
room O
, O
knowing O
that O
Gavin B-PERSON
although O
he O
had O
told O
her O
that O
he O
loved O
her O
, O
was O
already O
flirting O
with O

that O
he O
had O
only O
met O
a B-TIME

Larry's B-PERSON
advice O
flashed O
through O
her O
mind O

but O
she O
turned O
away O
, O
giving O
a O
little O
gesture O
of O
hopelessness O
, O
knowing O
that O
her O
The O

all O
dancing O

as O

drew O
out O
a O

sat O
down O
Gavin B-PERSON

without O
a O

the O

" O
It O

mean O
anything O
, O
" O
Gay B-PERSON
told O
herself O
desperately O
, O
trying O
to O
understand O
Gavin's B-PERSON
point O
of O
view O
and O
remembering O
the O
advice O
that O
Larry B-PERSON
had O
given O
her O
, O
while O
she O
felt O
wretched O
beyond O
words O
. O

His O
behaviour O
was O
not O
only O
boorish O
and O
in O
the O
worst O
of O
taste O
but O
it O
was O
unkind O
beyond O
words O
. O

She O
fumbled O
with O
the O
cigarette O
packet O
which O
lay O
on O
the O
table O
not O
wanting O
to O
smoke O

needing O
some O
action O

her O
control O
her O

as O

a O

As O

" O

She O
couldn't O
remember O
what O
they O
had O
been O
talking O
about O

which O
' O
lark O
' O
she O
would O
have O
to O
stop O

only O
that O
significant O
tiny O
word O
shouted O
into O
her O
very O
soul O
a O
horn O
of O
warning O
, O
and O
with O
it O
was O
coupled O
a O
disembodied O
fragment O
of O
information O
, O
which O
now O
took O
on O
an O
ominous O
significance O
: O
Nigel B-PERSON
had O
been O
seen O
in O
Farlingham B-LOCATION
on O
an O
occasion O
he O
had O
sworn O
he O
had O
been O
standing O
in O
for O
Luke B-PERSON
Parsons I-PERSON
at O
his O
surgery O
in O
Little B-LOCATION
Phelpham I-LOCATION
. O

Now O
Nigel B-PERSON
had O
every O
right O
to O
go O
where O
he O
liked O
during O
his O
off-duty O
periods O
when O
she O
was O
not O
free O
; O
this O
much O
they O
had O
conceded O
one O
to O
the O
other O
. O

They O
rarely O
found O
they O
were O
off O
duty O
together O
, O
and O
the O
situation O
would O
have O
been O
intolerable O
had O
there O
not O
been O
some O
give O
and O
take O
about O
their O
relationship O
. O

So O
when O
Nigel B-PERSON
had O
told O
her O
about O
taking O
Luke's B-PERSON
evening B-TIME
surgery O
she O
had O
said O
, O
" O
Bless O
you O
! O

I O
hope O
Luke B-PERSON
is O
suitably O
grateful O
, O
darling O
. O

" O
" O
Oh O

he O
shrugged O
diffidently O
, O
" O

plenty O
of O
variety O

it O

" O

hopefully O

" O
Hardly O

, O
my O

Luke's B-PERSON

' O
' O
Nicholas B-PERSON
- O
' O
' O
Well O
! O

At O
least O
I O
know O
the O
truth O
. O

Truth O
! O

' O
His O
gaze O
held O
hers O
masterfully O
. O

' O
You O
wanted O
it O
so O
badly O
- O
at O
any O
price O
. O

I O
hope O
you O
are O
satisfied O
. O

' O
And O
as O
he O
spoke O
, O
the O
thought O
of O
Philip B-PERSON
lying O
in O
the O
other O
room O
filled O
him O
with O
a O
re- O
vulsion O
that O
was O
homicidal O
. O

Even O
in O
that O
, O
his O
hands O
were O
tied O
. O

He O
dare O
not O
precipitate O
what O
might O
well O
be O
another O
coronary O
. O

And O
in O
that B-TIME
second I-TIME
he O
put O
back O
his O
professional O
mantle O
, O
and O
said O
with O
such O
icy O
politeness O
, O
such O
withdrawn O
' O
I O
will O
leave O
you O
the O
necessary O
pre- O
scription O
for O
the O
sedatives O
. O

You O
will O
contact O
your O
new O
doctor O
when O
you O
reach O
your O
parents' O
house O
. O

' O
She O
watched O
him O
flick O
his O
fountain-pen O
from O
his O
waistcoat O
pocket O
, O
take O
out O
his O
 O
prescription O
pad O
, O
and O
 O
scribble O
on O
it O
. O

Then O
, O
with O
a O
gesture O
she O
knew O
so O
well O
, O
he O
tore O
off O
the O
leaflet O
and O
' O
Good-bye O
, O
Sandra B-PERSON
, O
' O
he O
said O
with O
a O
deadly O
finality O
. O

Watching O
him O
go O
, O
unable O
to O
speak O
, O
she O
felt O
that O
part O
of O
her O
was O
leaving O
him O
. O

She O
couldn't O
hate O
him O
... O
If O
only O
he O
would O
have O
con- O
fided O
in O
her O
, O
given O
some O
expla- O
nation O
. O

Now O
there O
was O
no- O
thing O
- O
not O
even O
friendship O
. O

She O
went O
back O
to O
Philip B-PERSON
. O

But O
all O
she O
could O
hear O
were O
Nicholas's B-PERSON
words O
: O
' O
I O
love O
you O
- O
oh O
, O
you O
know O
that O
well O
enough O
. O

' O
Love O
. O

She O
revolted O
against O
the O
word O
. O

Nicholas B-PERSON
, O
Philip B-PERSON
... O
where O
was O
happiness O
, O
or O
peace O
of O
mind O
? O

Philip B-PERSON
put O
out O
a O
hand O
and O
grasped O
hers O
. O

He O
needed O
her O
. O

She O
would O
find O
solace O
in O
that O
fact O
at O
least O
. O

She O
had O
her O
truth O
. O

How O
much O
had O
built O
up O
from O
that O
first B-CARDINAL
ideal O
, O
and O
how O
little O
joy O
, O
or O
satisfaction O
, O
it O
had O
given O
her O
. O

' O
I O
'm O
sorry O
, O
darling O
. O

' O
He O
looked O
nervous O
. O

It O
had O
been O
hell O
lying O
there O
, O
knowing O
she O
was O
talking O
to O
Nicholas B-PERSON
and O
wondering O
what O
they O
were O
saying O
. O

Sandra B-PERSON
said O
instinctively O
: O
' O
I O
told O
him O
I O
knew O
he O
was O
responsible O
for O
Beryl's B-PERSON
death O
. O

' O
Her O
eyes O
darkened O
in O
torment O
. O

' O
Are O
you O
sure O
that O
she O
was O
telling O
the O
truth O
? O

' O
' O
Good O
heavens O
, O
darling O
, O
why O
on O
earth O
should O
she O
lie O
? O

Besides O
, O
it O
wasn't O
just O
her O
word O
. O

There O
was O
enough O
evidence O
, O
no O
matter O
how O
one O
might O
want O
to O
disbelieve O
the O
facts O
. O

' O
Elation O
touched O
him O
after O
the O
cold O
wind O
of O
suspense O
. O

' O
It O
will O
be O
interesting O
to O
see O
what O
comes O
out O
at O
the O
inquest O
. O

What O
his O
story O
will O
be O
. O

I O
reckon O
he O
'll O
confine O
himself O
to O
the O
nervous O
origin O
of O
her O
recent O
illness O
. O

His O
notes O
will O
be O
truthful O
, O
but O
what O
he O
leaves O
out O
will O
matter O
most O
. O

' O
Strange O
how O
just O
then O
Philip B-PERSON
was O
so O
certain O
that O
Nicholas B-PERSON
would O
never O
betray O
him O
. O

He O
loved O
Sandra B-PERSON
too O
deeply O
to O
ruin O
her O
future O
happiness O
. O

Had O
ever O
circum- O
stances O
conspired O
so O
cunningly O
? O

Philip's B-PERSON
spirits O
soared O
. O

He O
was O
better O
; O
he O
had O
made O
a O
miraculous O
recovery O
and O
Sandra B-PERSON
would O
soon O
be O
his O
wife O
. O

The O
Devil B-PERSON
, O
he O
thought O
, O
certainly O
looked O
after O
his O
own O
. O

Something O
in O
Sandra's B-PERSON
attitude O
struck O
him O
suddenly O
, O
making O
him O
say O
: O
' O
You O
can't O
forgive O
him O
for O
this O
- O
can O
you O
? O

' O
' O
Forgive O
is O
an O
unctuous O
, O
patronizing O
word O
, O
' O
she O
replied O
. O

' O
I O
despise O
the O
deceit O
. O

The O
lies O
. O

' O
His O
voice O
was O
like O
his O
black O
and O
pin-stripe O
, O
a O
grey O
superimposition O
of O
respectability O
over O
the O
original O
colour O
of O
his O
own O
natural O
vowels O
, O
the O
result O
being O
somehow O
as O
ineffective O
, O
not O
just O
dusty-grey O
but O
muddy O
, O
slimy O
even O
. O

His O
digressions O
too O
, O
seemed O
to O
have O
no O
other O
purpose O
than O
the O
throwing O
of O
dust O
in O
his O
client's O
eyes O
, O
the O
dust O
of O
fake O
security O
, O
of O
the O
fake O
friend O
of O
the O
family O
, O
like O
the O
