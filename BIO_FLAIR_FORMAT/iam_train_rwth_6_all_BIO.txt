it O

Mr. O
Quinim B-PERSON
Pholsena I-PERSON
, O
who O
claims O
to O
be O
his O
representative O
in O
Laos B-LOCATION
, O
yesterday B-TIME
addressed O
all O
officers O
of O
the O
pro-communist O

occupying O
the O
province O

Xieng B-LOCATION
Khouang I-LOCATION

emphasized O
that O
Prince O

Lao I-ORGANIZATION
Haksat I-ORGANIZATION

also O
to O
the O
officers O
in O
the O
same O
terms O
. O

This O
emphasis O
on O
the O
legality O
of O
the O
former O
Government B-ORGANIZATION
suggests O
that O
all O
is O
not O
well O
with O
the O
political O
and O
military O
leadership O
of O
the O
pro-communists O
. O

Most O

The O
Government B-ORGANIZATION
has O
claimed O
the O
recapture O
of O
Vang B-LOCATION
Vieng I-LOCATION
, O
the O
pro- O

former O

60 B-CARDINAL

this O
claim O
A O
correspondent O
who O
travelled O
yesterday B-TIME
to O
within O
a O
few O

Vieng I-LOCATION

160 B-CARDINAL
speeches O
in O
80 B-CARDINAL
constituencies O
in O
10 B-TIME
days I-TIME
, O
the O
Liberal B-ORGANIZATION
Party I-ORGANIZATION
are O
holding O
a O
national O
conference O
here O
with O
some B-CARDINAL
2,000 I-CARDINAL
delegates O
, O
the O
biggest O
gathering O
since O
1958 B-TIME
when O
Mr. O
Lester B-PERSON
Pearson I-PERSON
was O
chosen O
as O
party O
leader O
. O

In O
some O
ways O
it O
will O
be O
a O
testing O
occasion O
for O
him O
, O
although O
some O
think O
his O
position O
unassailable O
simply O
because O
there O
is O
no O
one O
else O
in O
sight O
to O
supplant O
him O
. O

So O
the O
con- O
ference O
will O
concentrate O
on O
laying O
the O
foundations O
on O
which O
to O
win O
the O
next O
election O
. O

The O
rally O
comes O
at O
a O
time O
when O
in O
spite O
of O
carefully O
worded O
state- O
ments O
by O
the O
Prime O
Minister O
there O
is O
an O
air O
of O
electoral O
expectancy O
. O

Members O
of O
the O
Cabinet B-ORGANIZATION
are O
basing O
their O
speeches O
on O
a O
new O
Conservative B-ORGANIZATION
booklet O
called O
The O
Record O
Speaks O
which O
outlines O
in O
some O
detail O
the O
accomplishments O
of O
the O
party O
since O
it O
came O
to O
office O
three B-TIME
and I-TIME
a I-TIME
half I-TIME
years I-TIME
ago I-TIME
. O

Nevertheless O
there O
is O
little O
illusion O
in O
the O
Conservative B-ORGANIZATION
Party I-ORGANIZATION
that O
their O
stock O
at O
home O
has O
fallen O
in O
the O
face O
of O
heavy O
unemployment O
and O
an O
uncertain O
economy O
. O

Last B-TIME

the O

and O
in O
the O
four B-CARDINAL
federal O
by-elections O
last B-TIME
October I-TIME
the O
party O
fared O
badly O
. O

They O
are O
now O
faced O
with O
four B-CARDINAL
other O

All O

Conservative B-ORGANIZATION
strongholds O

Last B-TIME
September I-TIME
a O
public O

showed O
that O
for O
the O
first B-CARDINAL
time O
since O
the O
Administration B-ORGANIZATION
came O
to O
power O
in O
1957 B-TIME
the O

However O
, O
a O
separate O
poll O
revealed O
that O
Mr. O
Diefenbaker B-PERSON
was O
still O
ahead O
in O
terms O
of O
popularity O
as O
an O
individual O
leader O
( O
for O
Mr. O
Diefenbaker B-PERSON
36 B-CARDINAL

for O
Mr. O

34 B-CARDINAL

. O

How O
far O
is O
Mr. O
Lester B-PERSON
Pearson I-PERSON
acceptable O
to O
the O
people O
of O
Canada B-LOCATION
as O
a O
Prime O
Minister O
? O

Many O
observers O
at O
the O
national O
rally O
will O
be O
seeking O
an O
answer O
. O

It O
is O
difficult O
for O
many O
to O
see O
Mr. O
Pearson B-PERSON
in O
the O
role O
of O
a O
popular O
orator O
at O
the O
hustings O
, O
the O
spellbinder O
that O
Mr. O
Diefen- B-PERSON

was O
in O
the O
last O
two B-CARDINAL
campaigns O
. O

The O
impression O
remains O
that O
the O
Liberal B-ORGANIZATION
leader O
is O
still O
the O
diplomatist O
, O
more O
at O
home O
in O
the O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
Mr. O
Pearson B-PERSON
excels O
in O
meeting O
people O
informally O
, O
but O
many O
still O
regard O
him O
" O
as O
some O
sort O
of O
cross O
between O
an O
egghead O

a O

for O
talks O
with O
the O
Federal B-ORGANIZATION

on O
a O
European B-NORP

rather O
sceptical O
about O
British B-NORP

Stated O
more O
bluntly O
, O
they O
are O
still O
unconvinced O
that O
this O
is O

primarily O
an O
effort O
on O

to O
salve O
Blue O

Mr. O
Thorneycroft's B-PERSON
main O
purpose O
will O
be O
to O
remove O
these O
doubts O

and O
to O
persuade O
the O
Federal B-ORGANIZATION
Government I-ORGANIZATION
that O
the O
financial O
burden O
involved O
is O
really O
worth O
while O
, O
at O
a O
time O
when O
any O
increase O
in O
budgetary O
commitments O
would O
almost O
certainly O
involve O
a O
corresponding O
rise O

something O
no O

contemplate O
in O
an B-TIME
election I-TIME

But O
, O
at O
the O

time O
, O
there O
is O
reason O
to O
believe O
that O
the O
Federal B-ORGANIZATION
Government I-ORGANIZATION
is O
not O
convinced O
, O
on O
the O
basis O
of O
the O
information O
it O
has O
so O
far O
, O
that O
such O
a O
project O
would O
be O
justified O
from O
a O
scientific O
point O

view O
; O
and O
not O
merely O
constitute O
a O
" O
prestige O

satellite O
, O
duplicating O
to O
some O
extent O
American B-NORP
efforts O

as O
Die B-ORGANIZATION

suggests O
today B-TIME
in O

critical O
editorial O

On O
the O
specific O
question O
of O
the O
use O
of O
Blue O

, O
Mr. O
Thorneycroft's B-PERSON
task O
will O
be O
easier O
. O

He O
can O
point O
out O
that O
this O
is O
the O
only O
rocket O
and O
launcher O
in O
Europe B-LOCATION
to O
have O
reached O
a O
sufficient O
stage O
of O
development O
for O
adaptation O
as O
the O
first B-CARDINAL
stage O
in O
putting O
a O
heavy O
satellite O
into O
outer O

. O

There O
has O
also O
been O
some O
talk O
of O
adopting O
another O
British B-NORP
rocket O
, O
Black O
Knight O
, O
for O
the O
second B-CARDINAL
stage O
, O
but O
the O
French B-NORP
have O
one O
of O
their O
own O
called O
Veronique O
which O
they O
would O
like O
to O
see O
used O
. O

The O
Foreign B-ORGANIZATION
Ministry I-ORGANIZATION
spokesman O
added O
today B-TIME
, O
however O
, O
that O
the O
Brussels B-LOCATION
Treaty O
was O
irrelevant O
, O
because O
research O
on O
the O
various O
rocket O
stages O
had O
already O
been O
concluded O
, O
and O
only O
cooperation O
on O
the O
type O
of O
capsule O
was O
involved O
. O

A O
lesser O
obstacle O
to O
German B-NORP
participation O
is O
the O
absence O
of O
any O
Ministry B-ORGANIZATION
or O
Minister O
directly O
responsible O

therefore O
of O
any O

MR. O
GAITSKELL B-PERSON
today B-TIME
delivered O
a O
full-blooded O
defence O
of O
the O
Polaris O
missile O
base O
. O

And O
by O
implication O
he O
supported O
the O
establishment O
of O
sites O
in O
Britain B-LOCATION
for O
the O
training O
of O
German B-NORP
troops O
. O

His O
main O
theme O
was O
that O
nuclear O
weapons O
were O
necessary O
to O
defend O
Britain B-LOCATION
, O
that O
Britain B-LOCATION
must O
depend O
on O
Nato B-ORGANIZATION
and O
" O
the O
West B-LOCATION
" O
must O
have O
nuclear O
weapons O
so O
long O
as O
the O
Soviet B-LOCATION
Union I-LOCATION
has O
them O
. O

Addressing O
the O
annual O
congress O
of O
the O
National B-ORGANIZATION
Union I-ORGANIZATION
of I-ORGANIZATION
General I-ORGANIZATION
and I-ORGANIZATION
Municipal I-ORGANIZATION
Workers I-ORGANIZATION
, O
he O
said O
he O
felt O
sure O
the O
Labour B-ORGANIZATION
movement O
was O
coming O
round O
in O
support O
of O
his O
views O
. O

Obviously O
conscious O
of O
the O
fierce O
and O
widespread O
resentment O
over O
the O
U.S. B-LOCATION
Polaris O
base O
in O
Britain B-LOCATION
, O
Mr. O
Gaitskell B-PERSON
said O
that O
he O
even O
noticed O
that O
supporters O
of O
unilateral O
nuclear O
disarmament O
were O
changing O
their O
tactics O
by O
switching O
most O
of O
their O
emphasis O
on O
to O
the O
missile O
. O

Mr O
Gaitskell B-PERSON
said O
that O
a O
member O
of O
an O
alliance O
could O
not O
deny O
facilities O
to O
nations O
to O
which O
it O
was O
allied O
. O

But O
governments O
should O
be O
free O
to O
negotiate O
and O
refuse O
proposals O
with O
which O
they O
did O
not O
agree O
. O

The O
Labour B-ORGANIZATION
Party I-ORGANIZATION
opposed O
Thor O
missiles O
, O
because O
, O
he O
said O
, O
they O
were O
out O
of O
date O
and O
vulnerable O
and O
would O
attract O
enemy O
action O
. O

That O
argument O
did O
not O
apply O
to O
the O
Polaris O
submarine O
. O

So O
long O
as O
the O
Soviet B-LOCATION
Union I-LOCATION
had O
nuclear O
weapons O
, O
the O
West B-LOCATION
, O
somewhere O
, O
must O
have O
them O
too O
. O

It O
was O
far O
better O
for O
a O
weapon O
used O
for O
retaliatory O
purposes O
to O
be O
under O
the O
sea O
rather O
than O
on O
land O
. O

This O
was O
why O
the O
Labour B-ORGANIZATION
Party I-ORGANIZATION
did O
not O
think O
it O
right O
to O
oppose O
the O
Polaris O
depot O
ship O
. O

The O
party O
agreed O
that O
it O
was O
unwise O
to O
locate O
the O
base O
in O
the O
Holy B-LOCATION
Loch I-LOCATION
, O
only O
30 B-CARDINAL
miles O
from O
Glasgow B-LOCATION
, O
a O
city O
with O
two B-CARDINAL
million I-CARDINAL
people O
. O

It O
should O
be O
sited O
in O
a O
more O
remote O
area O
. O

Mr. O
Gaitskell B-PERSON
added O
that O
the O
Scarborough B-LOCATION
conference O
decisions O
did O
not O
, O
in O
his O
view O
, O
truly O
reflect O
the O
opinions O
of O
the O
majority O
of O
party O
members O
and O
still O
less O
the O
party's O
supporters O
in O
the O
country O
. O

Mr O
Gaitskell B-PERSON
added O
that O
agreement O
with O
the O
unilateralists O
was O
not O
possible O
, O
though O
he O
respected O
their O
views O
. O

He O
saw O
by O
reports O
that O
" O
those O
who O
organise O
these O
things O
" O
were O
recommending O
the O
supporters O
of O
unilateral O
nuclear O
disarmament O
to O
shift O
the O
emphasis O
of O
their O
intervention O
away O
from O
straight O
opposition O
to O
the O
official O
document O
on O
to O
opposition O
to O
the O
Polaris O
base O
. O

To O
Mr. O
Macmillan B-PERSON
, O
Mr O
Gaitskell B-PERSON
said O
the O
Prime O
Minister O
should O
begin O
to O
take O
seriously O
the O
danger O
of O
the O
spread O
of O
nuclear O
weapons O
within O
the O
Nato B-ORGANIZATION
alliance O
. O

" O
Let O
us O
say O
to O
Macmillan B-PERSON
that O
he O
should O
press O
, O
I O
hope O
with O
the O
agreement O
of O
Kennedy B-PERSON
, O
in O
talks O
with O
the O
Soviet B-LOCATION
Union I-LOCATION
, O
for O
the O
establishment O
in O
central O
Europe B-LOCATION
of O
a O
zone O
of O
controlled O
disarmament O
. O

" O
He O
thought O
, O
he O
said O
, O
that O
the O
Soviet B-LOCATION
Union I-LOCATION
would O
be O
prepared O
to O
reach O
an O
agreement O
on O
a O
zone O
of O
controlled O
disarmament O
in O
Europe B-LOCATION
. O

Mr O
Gaitskell B-PERSON
concluded O
, O
declaring O
that O
the O
present O
was O
the O
beginning O
of O
a O
great O
period O
of O
opportunity O
for O
the O
party O
. O

It O
was O
a O
great O
chance O
that O
should O
be O
grasped O
. O

Inter-union O
jealousies O
prevent O
the O
fulfilment O
of O
a O
common O
policy O
for O
wages O
and O
other O
major O
questions O
, O
Mr. O
Jack B-PERSON
Cooper I-PERSON
The O
General B-ORGANIZATION
Council I-ORGANIZATION
of I-ORGANIZATION
the I-ORGANIZATION
Trades I-ORGANIZATION
Union I-ORGANIZATION
Congress I-ORGANIZATION
should O
therefore O
consider O
the O
matter O
. O

Consideration O
should O
also O
be O
given O
to O
the O
regrouping O
of O
unions O
and O
the O
modification O
of O
their O
structures O
to O
meet O
the O
growing O
concentration O
of O
capital O
. O

Mr. O
Cooper B-PERSON
argued O
that O
a O
common O
industrial O
contribution O
was O
urgent O
- O
particularly O
in O
unions O
serving O
workers O
in O
the O
same O
industry O
- O
along O
Suggesting O
that O
a O
total O
T.U.C. B-ORGANIZATION
membership O
of O
eight B-CARDINAL
million I-CARDINAL
was O
a O
" O
poor O
show O
" O
compared O
with O
some O
countries O
, O
he O
argued O
that O
the O
position O
needed O
examination O
. O

BEFORE O
President O
Kennedy B-PERSON
met O
Mr. O
Macmillan B-PERSON
yesterday B-TIME
morning I-TIME
he O
was O
given O
the O
views O
of O
a O
wide O
section O
of O
the O
British B-NORP
people O
about O
Polaris O
submarine O
bases O
in O
this O
country O
. O

An O
open O
letter O
written O
by O
Earl O
Russell B-PERSON
hoping O
that O
the O
Earl O
Russell B-PERSON
, O
President O
of O
the O
Committee B-ORGANIZATION
of I-ORGANIZATION
100 I-ORGANIZATION
, O
told O
Kennedy B-PERSON
that O
he O
should O
take O
notice O
of O
" O
that O
very O
large O
and O
growing O
section O
which O
is O
opposed O
to O
the O
establishment O
of O
a O
Polaris O
base O
, O
whether O
at O
Holy B-LOCATION
Loch I-LOCATION
or O
elsewhere O
on O
British B-NORP
territory O
. O

" O
He O
pointed O
out O
that O
already O
there O
have O
been O
protests O
but O
that O
" O
very O
much O
larger O
protests O
are O
to O
be O
expected O
and O
are O
being O
planned O
. O

" O
There O
are O
three B-CARDINAL
kinds O
of O
reasons O
that O
justify O
the O
protests O
and O
these O
should O
carry O
weight O
with O
the O
U.S. B-ORGANIZATION
Government I-ORGANIZATION
, O
Earl O
Russell B-PERSON
suggested O
. O

" O
The O
first B-CARDINAL
of O
these O
reasons O
is O
the O
importance O
of O
pre- O
serving O
the O
hitherto O
cordial O
relations O
between O
the O
U.S. B-LOCATION
and O
Great B-LOCATION
Britain I-LOCATION
, O
not O
only O
in O
Government B-ORGANIZATION
circles O
, O
but O
in O
public O
opinion O
. O

" O
Earl O
Russell B-PERSON
says O
it O
is O
inevitable O
, O
though O
profoundly O
regrettable O
, O
that O
the O
agitation O
against O
the O
Polaris O
base O
has O
generated O
some O
antagonism O
to O
the O
policy O
of O
the O
United B-LOCATION
States I-LOCATION
. O

The O
second B-CARDINAL
reason O
is O
concerned O
with O
doubts O
as O
to O
the O
safety O
of O
the O
people O
of O
Great B-LOCATION
Britain I-LOCATION
; O
" O
in O
the O
time O
of O
crisis O
it O
would O
probably O
be O
impossible O
for O
the O
British B-NORP
authorities O
to O
exercise O
any O
degree O
of O
control O
over O
the O
action O
of O
Polaris O
submarines O
. O

" O
He O
argues O
that O
there O
is O
a O
distinct O
possibility O
that O
so O
long O
as O
there O
is O
a O
Polaris O
base O
in O
Britain B-LOCATION
the O
Soviet B-LOCATION
Union I-LOCATION
might O
retaliate O
against O
Britain B-LOCATION
alone O
. O

" O
Such O
retaliation O
might O
, O
and O
probably O
would O
, O
destroy O
the O
whole O
population O
of O
Britain B-LOCATION
in O
the O
course O
of O
, O
at O
the O
most O
, O
an B-TIME
hour I-TIME
" O
without O
provoking O
American B-NORP
retaliation O
. O

Earl O
Russell B-PERSON
believes O
: O
" O
It O
is O
very O
questionable O
whether O
British B-NORP
membership O
of O
Nato B-ORGANIZATION
and O
British B-NORP
permission O
of O
American B-NORP
bases O
on O
our O
territory O
add O
anything O
to O
the O
strength O
of O
America B-LOCATION
, O
while O
, O
on O
the O
contrary O
, O
they O
impose O
upon O
America B-LOCATION
an O
onerous O
obligation O
which O
it O
may O
prove O
impossible O
to O
fulfil O
. O

" O
The O
third B-CARDINAL
reason O
is O
that O
the O
supreme O
interest O
for O
the O
whole O
world O
- O
East B-LOCATION
and O
West B-LOCATION
and O
uncommitted O
nations O
- O
is O
the O
prevention O
of O
nuclear O
war O
. O

" O
A O
rapidly O
growing O
body O
of O
opinion O
in O
this O
country O
believes O
that O
Britain B-LOCATION
could O
be O
more O
effective O
in O
preventing O
a O
nuclear O
war O
as O
a O
neutral O
by O
helping O
to O
suggest O
agreements O
which O
could O
be O
accepted O
by O
both O
East B-LOCATION
and O
West B-LOCATION
. O

" O
THE O
next O
White O
Paper O
on O
defence O
, O
to O
be O
published O
in O
March B-TIME
, O
is O
likely O
to O
contain O
a O
five-year B-TIME
plan O
for O
the O
three B-ORGANIZATION
Services I-ORGANIZATION
. O

Its O
aim O
will O
be O
to O
produce O
superbly O
equipped O
, O
all-Regular O
forces O
of O
about B-CARDINAL
400,000 I-CARDINAL
men O
. O

The O
three B-ORGANIZATION
Services I-ORGANIZATION
would O
be O
" O
integrated O
" O
to O
a O
greater O
extent O
than O
ever O
before O
. O

Short O
of O
wearing O
the O
same O
uniform O
, O
which O
is O
not O
contemplated O
, O
the O
Navy B-ORGANIZATION
, O
Army B-ORGANIZATION
and O
Royal B-ORGANIZATION
Air I-ORGANIZATION
Force I-ORGANIZATION
would O
become O
, O
for O
practical O
purposes O
, O
a O
single O
defence O
force O
. O

There O
would O
be O
complete O
co-operation O
at O
all O
levels O
in O
training O
and O
operations O
. O

This O
would O
apply O
also O
in O
the O
command O
structure O
and O
central O
administrative O
organisation O
. O

Mr. O
Watkinson B-PERSON
, O
Minister O
of O
Defence O
, O
has O
been O
working O
on O
the O
plan O
for O
some B-TIME
months I-TIME
, O
with O
the O
Prime O
Minister's O
approval O
. O

He O
has O
had O
numerous O
meetings O
with O
the O
Service O
Ministers O
. O

He O
has O
also O
had O
talks O
with O
the O
Earl O
of O
Home B-PERSON
, O
Foreign O
Secretary O
, O
and O
with O
other O
Ministers O
concerned O
with O
overseas O
aspects O
of O
defence O
policy O
. O

Details O
of O
the O
scheme O
are O
now O
being O
worked O
out O
by O
the O
Chiefs O
of O
Staff O
, O
a O
process O
that O
may O
take O
four B-TIME
or I-TIME
five I-TIME
months I-TIME
. O

The O
scheme O
will O
be O
subject O
to O
Cabinet B-ORGANIZATION
approval O
. O

Mr. O
Watkinson B-PERSON
remains O
con- O
vinced O
that O
the O
policy O
initiated O
in O
1957 B-TIME
, O
in O
Mr. O
Sandys's B-PERSON
time O
as O
Minister O
of O
Defence O
, O
is O
still O
correct O
. O

This O
was O
to O
return O
to O
the O
tradition O
of O
all-Regular O
voluntary O
forces O
, O
with O
the O
last O
National O
Serviceman O
out O
of O
uniform O
by O
the B-TIME
end I-TIME
of I-TIME
1962 I-TIME
. O

The O
Minister O
regards O
the O
recent O
trend O
of O
recruiting O
figures O
as O
encouraging O
. O

He O
is O
confident O
the O
aim O
can O
be O
achieved O
. O

While O
the O
possibility O
of O
an O
eventual O
return O
to O
National O
Service O
in O
some O
form O
cannot O
be O
entirely O
discounted O
, O
he O
does O
not O
agree O
that O
the O
point O
has O
been O
reached O
where O
this O
need O
even O
be O
considered O
. O

If O
National O
Service O
is O
ever O
resorted O
to O
, O
engagement O
would O
probably O
have O
to O
be O
for O
three B-TIME
years I-TIME
. O

It O
is O
thought O
this O
would O
be O
the O
minimum O
necessary O
for O
the O
extended O
training O
modern O
arms O
require O
and O
to O
enable O
each O
man O
to O
serve O
at B-TIME
least I-TIME
a I-TIME
year I-TIME
overseas O
. O

There O
is O
no O
truth O
in O
suggestions O
that O
Mr. O
Watkinson B-PERSON
is O
at O
odds O
with O
the O
Service B-ORGANIZATION
chiefs O
over O
the O
decision O
to O
dispense O
with O
National O
Service O
, O
or O
over O
any O
other O
aspect O
of O
defence O
policy O
. O

Criticisms O
about O
Army B-ORGANIZATION
manpower O
appear O
to O
have O
come O
mainly O
from O
retired O
officers O
who O
have O
held O
high O
positions O
but O
are O
out O
of O

the O

The O
hand-over O
, O
due O
in O
September B-TIME
, O
was O
delayed O
because O
of O
the O
Berlin B-LOCATION
crisis O
. O

Mr. O
Watkinson B-PERSON
and O
his O
advisers O
felt O
the O
change O
would O
be O
unwise O
at O
a O
moment O
 O
when O
attention O
had O
to O
be O
concentrated O
on O
possible O
need O
for O
important O
military O
operations O
. O

For O
this O
reason O
Sir O
Francis B-PERSON
stayed O
on O
, O
and O
 O
sacrificed O
his O
leave O
. O

There O
was O
a O
computed O
8.4 B-CARDINAL
per O
cent. O
swing O
towards O
the O
Nationalist B-ORGANIZATION
party I-ORGANIZATION
of O
Dr. O
Verwoerd B-PERSON
, O
the O
Prime O
Minister O
. O

This O
implies O
the O
dis- O
appearance O
of O
the O
Progressive B-ORGANIZATION
party I-ORGANIZATION
from O
the O
House B-ORGANIZATION
. O

Early O
results O
in O
yesterday's B-TIME
general O
election O
showed O
Nationalists B-NORP
being O
returned O

their O
strongholds O

Mr. O

Long O
before O
polling O
closed O
at O
8 B-TIME
p.m. I-TIME
it O
was O
evident O
that O
voters O
were O
bored O
by O
the O
Government's B-ORGANIZATION
frequent O
appeals O
to O
the O
electorate O
. O

The O
election O
was O
the O
fourth B-CARDINAL
in O
four B-TIME
years I-TIME
. O

In O
most O
constituencies O
it O
may O
go O
down O
as O
the O
most O
apathetic O
in O
the O
country's O
history O
. O

THE O
Prime O
Minister O
disclosed O
in O
the O
Commons B-ORGANIZATION
last B-TIME
night I-TIME
that O
he O
had O
considered O
early O
in O
the O
Parliamentary B-ORGANIZATION
recess O
whether O
to O
mobilise O
reserves O
necessary O
to O
bring O
the O
British B-ORGANIZATION
Army I-ORGANIZATION
of I-ORGANIZATION
the I-ORGANIZATION
Rhine I-ORGANIZATION
on O
to O
a O
war O
footing O
. O

He O
decided O
that O
it O
would O
be O
a O
great O
error O
to O
do O
so O
and O
to O
recall O
Parliament B-ORGANIZATION
. O

But O
there O
would O
be O
no O
hesitation O
in O
mobilising O
if O
a O
further O
deterioration O
in O
the O
situation O
warranted O
such O
a O
step O
. O

It O
would O
have O
to O
be O
accompanied O
by O
other O
measures O
of O
a O
military O
, O
economic O
and O
political O
kind O
. O

Mr. O
Macmillan B-PERSON
, O
who O
was O
winding O
up O
the O
foreign O
affairs O
debate O
, O
said O
the O
Government B-ORGANIZATION
could O
not O
be O
party O
to O
accepting O
as O
a O
matter O
of O
principle O
the O
imposed O
division O
of O
Germany B-LOCATION
. O

" O
We O
must O
not O
be O
rattled O
into O
surrender O
, O
but O
we O
must O
not O
- O
and O
I O
am O
not O
- O
be O
afraid O
of O
negotiation O
. O

" O
Mr. O
Godber B-PERSON
, O
Minister O
of O
State O
, O
Foreign B-ORGANIZATION
Office I-ORGANIZATION
, O
said O
earlier O
that O
the O
Government B-ORGANIZATION
had O
asked O
the O
Medical B-ORGANIZATION
Research I-ORGANIZATION
Council I-ORGANIZATION
to O
reassess O
the O
fall-out O
position O
in O
view O
of O
the O
Russian B-NORP
tests O
. O

The O
Council's B-ORGANIZATION
findings O
would O
be O
made O
public O
. O

With O
a O
vigour O
and O
authority O
which O
delighted O
old O
Parliamentary B-ORGANIZATION
friends O
and O
foes O
alike O
, O
the O
Earl O
of O
Avon B-LOCATION
, O
the O
former O
Sir O
Anthony B-PERSON
Eden I-PERSON
, O
in O
his O
maiden O
speech O
in O
the O
House B-ORGANIZATION
of I-ORGANIZATION
Lords I-ORGANIZATION
last B-TIME
night I-TIME
, O
gave O
a O
warning O
that O
 O
appeasement O
over O
Berlin B-LOCATION
could O
only O
lead O
to O
war O
. O

To O
stand O
firm O
, O
he O
declared O
, O
was O
not O
to O
invite O
war O
, O
but O
the O
surest O
way O
to O
avert O
it O
. O

It O
was O
the O
end O
of O
a O
rather O
curious O
speech O
in O
which O
Mr. O
Macmillan B-PERSON
wound O
up O
the O
two-day B-TIME
debate O
on O
foreign O
affairs O
. O

He O
began O
in O
a O
low O
, O
almost O
chatty O
mono- O
tone O
, O
and O
his O
voice O
never O
rose O
to O
any O
accent O
of O
urgency O
. O

He O
passed O
in O
rapid O
review O
the O
United B-ORGANIZATION
Nations I-ORGANIZATION
Secretariat I-ORGANIZATION
; O
nuclear O
tests O
; O
the O
canard O
about O
British B-NORP
interference O
with O
the O
United B-ORGANIZATION
Nations I-ORGANIZATION
in O
the O
Congo B-LOCATION
; O
Kuwait B-LOCATION
; O
and O
South-East B-LOCATION
Asia I-LOCATION
. O

He O
spent O
most O
of O
his O
short O
half-hour B-TIME
on O
Berlin B-LOCATION
. O

He O
deplored O
the O
possibility O
of O
some O
" O
new O
myth O
" O
about O
betrayal O
of O
Germany B-LOCATION
by O
the O
Allies B-NORP
. O

" O
We O
do O
not O
, O
" O
he O
said O
, O
" O
really O
know O
what O
the O
Russians B-NORP
want O
. O

" O
But O
he O
was O
certain O
that O
they O
wanted O
to O
establish O
a O
final O
and O
irrevocable O
division O
of O
Germany B-LOCATION
. O

Britain B-LOCATION
could O
not O
be O
a O
party O
to O
an O
imposed O
division O
. O

But O
negotiation O
, O
as O
the O
debate O
had O
shown O
, O
could O
be O
undertaken O
on O
a O
variety O
of O
bases O
. O

Mr. O
Macmillan B-PERSON
explained O
that O
he O
had O
deliber- O
ately O
refrained O
during O
the O
summer B-TIME
from O
recalling O
Parliament B-ORGANIZATION
or O
ordering O
mobilisation O
by O
proclamation O
, O
such O
as O
would O
be O
necessary O
to O
bring O
the O
British B-ORGANIZATION
Army I-ORGANIZATION
of I-ORGANIZATION
the I-ORGANIZATION
Rhine I-ORGANIZATION
on O
to O
a O
fully O
active O
footing O
. O

That O
would O
have O
created O
a O
thoroughly O
unde- O
sirable O
atmosphere O
of O
panic O
. O

He O
thought O
that O
the O
situation O
was O
rather O
more O
hopeful O
. O

The O
Russians B-NORP
now O
realised O
its O
seriousness O
. O

The O
French B-NORP
doubts O
were O
more O
about O
procedure O
than O
about O
substance O
. O

The O
Prime O
Minister's O
attitude O
of O
studied O
calm O
brought O
down O
the O
temperature O
of O
the O
debate O
, O
which O
never O
at O
any O
time O
rose O
to O
fever O
pitch O
, O
to O
a O
remarkable O
degree O
of O
sub-normality O
. O

Throughout O
Mr. O
Macmillan's B-PERSON
speech O
the O
Earl O
of O
Home B-PERSON
, O
Foreign O
Secretary O
, O
was O
listening O
in O
the O
Peers' B-LOCATION
Gallery I-LOCATION
. O

The O
early O
speakers O
in O
the O
debate O
each O
severely O
rated O
the O
speech O
of O
his O
predecessor O
. O

These O
strictures O
were O
all O
too O
well O
justified O
. O

We O
started O
with O
the O
plaintive O
wailings O
of O
Mr. O
Healey B-PERSON
, O
" O
Shadow O
" O
Foreign O
Secretary O
, O
described O
by O
Mr. O
Godber B-PERSON
, O
Minister O
of O
State O
, O
Foreign B-ORGANIZATION
Office I-ORGANIZATION
, O
as O
" O
pedantic O
and O
obscure O
on O
Berlin B-LOCATION
, O
damaging O
and O
obscure O
on O
the O
Congo B-LOCATION
. O

" O
In O
turn O
, O
Mr. O
Godber B-PERSON
was O
censured O
by O
Mr. O
Shinwell B-PERSON
, O
former O
Labour B-ORGANIZATION
Defence O
Minister O
, O
for O
having O
read O
the O
The O
trouble O
about O
such O
debates O
is O
that O
they O
range O
too O
widely O
. O

They O
remind O
one O
of O
the O
Rugby O
match O
in O
" O
Tom B-PERSON
Brown's I-PERSON
Schooldays O
, O
" O
in O
which O
all O
the O
boys O
were O
welcome O
to O
take O
part O
, O
and O
only O
those O
who O
" O
really O
meant O
business O
" O
removed O
their O
jackets O
. O

Not O
many O
metaphorical O
braces O
were O
visible O
in O
the O
early O
stages O
of O
to-night's B-TIME
debate O
. O

Mr. O
Healey B-PERSON
had O
another O
tilt O
at O
the O
Prime O
Minister's O
golf-course O
Press O
conference O
, O
which O
he O
described O
as O
" O
a O
display O
of O
flabby O
and O
A O
reference O
to O
the O
reunification O
of O
Germany B-LOCATION
brought O
a O
bark O
of O
" O
Start O
another O
war O
! O

" O
from O
Mr. O
Ellis B-PERSON
Smith I-PERSON
( O
Lab. B-ORGANIZATION
, O
Stoke B-LOCATION
on I-LOCATION
Trent I-LOCATION
S. I-LOCATION
) O
. O

Then O
Mr. O
Healey B-PERSON
launched O
out O
on O
his O
pet O
theme O
of O
limitation O
of O
armaments O
in O
Europe B-LOCATION
. O

This O
could O
, O
he O
suggested O
, O
be O
linked O
with O
prohibition O
of O
the O
production O
of O
atomic O
weapons O
in O
any O
part O
of O
Europe B-LOCATION
. O

Inspection O
and O
control O
would O
be O
much O
easier O
to O
establish O
in O
these O
territories O
. O

Mr. O
Healey B-PERSON
denounced O
the O
Government B-ORGANIZATION
for O
using O
double O
standards O
. O

Ministers O
had O
rebuked O
the O
unaligned O
nations O
for O
not O
condemning O
the O
new O
Russian B-NORP
tests O
, O
but O
they O
themselves O
had O
no O
condemnation O
for O
events O
in O
Angola B-LOCATION
or O
Algeria B-LOCATION
. O

It O
was O
not O
for O
the O
Government B-ORGANIZATION
, O
said O
Mr. O
Healey B-PERSON
, O
to O
take O
up O
moral O
attitudes O
, O
" O
especially O
when O
the O
temple O
of O
their O
religion O
is O
the O
bingo-parlour O
. O

" O
This O
puzzled O
such O
students O
of O
comparative O
religion O
as O
had O
failed O
to O
detect O
this O
cult O
. O

But O
Mr. O
Healey B-PERSON
had O
a O
partial O
and O
limited O
success O
. O

He O
rallied O
behind O
him O
the O
Left-wing O
opinion O
so O
coolly O
snubbed O
last B-TIME
night I-TIME
by O
his O
leader O
, O
Mr. O
Gaitskell B-PERSON
. O

Mr. O
Godber's B-PERSON
performance O
merited O
all O
the O
mild O
scorn O
heaped O
on O
it O
by O
Mr. O
Shinwell B-PERSON
. O

True O
, O
he O
did O
tell O
the O
House B-ORGANIZATION
that O
the O
Government B-ORGANIZATION
had O
asked O
the O
Medical B-ORGANIZATION
Research I-ORGANIZATION
Council I-ORGANIZATION
to O
reassess O
the O
fall-out O
position O
in O
view O
of O
the O
Russian B-NORP
tests O
, O
and O
said O
that O
the O
council's B-ORGANIZATION
findings O
would O
be O
published O
. O

He O
was O
not O
so O
happy O
in O
his O
defence O
of O
the O
Government's B-ORGANIZATION
failure O
to O
condemn O
France B-LOCATION
for O
her O
nuclear O
tests O
in O
the O
Sahara B-LOCATION
on O
the O
grounds O
that O
they O
were O
only O
little O
ones O
. O

This O
was O
too O
reminiscent O
of O
the O
nursemaid O
and O
her O
illegitimate O
baby O
. O

For O
the O
most O
part O
, O
Mr. O
Godber B-PERSON
muttered O
his O
way O
through O
a O
cliche-ridden O
Foreign B-ORGANIZATION
Office I-ORGANIZATION
brief O
. O

He O
resembles O
the O
elephant O
seal O
, O
an O
 O
otherwise O
endearing O
creature O
whose O
articulation O
is O
limited O
, O
we O
are O
told O

to O
a O
series O
of O
heavy O
sighs O

MR. O
MACMILLAN'S B-PERSON
announcement O
in O
the O
Commons B-ORGANIZATION
of O
his O
momentous O
Mr. O
Anthony B-PERSON
Fell I-PERSON
( O
Yarmouth B-LOCATION
) O
called O
the O
decision O
" O
shocking O
" O
and O
added O
: O
" O
It O
is O
the O
most O
disastrous O
thing O
any O
Prime O
Minister O
has O
done O
for O
many O
, O
many O
generations O
. O

" O
He O
concluded O
: O
" O
The O
best O
service O
the O
Prime O
Minister O
can O
do O
would O
be O
to O
resign O
. O

" O
The O
outburst O
shocked O
MPs O
of O
all O
parties O
. O

Even O
close O
friends O
were O
signalling O
Mr. O
Fell B-PERSON
to O
stop O
. O

There O
were O
loud O
cries O
of O
" O
shame O
" O
from O
all O
parts O
of O
the O
Conservative B-ORGANIZATION
side O
. O

Mr. O
Fell B-PERSON
appeared O
to O
be O
in O
tears O
as O
he O
sat O
down O
. O

A B-TIME
few I-TIME
minutes I-TIME
later I-TIME
, O
Mr. O
Fell B-PERSON
got O
up O
and O
left O
the O
chamber O
. O

He O
returned O
five B-TIME
minutes I-TIME
later I-TIME
to O
stand O
just O
inside O
the O
doorway O
looking O
more O
composed O
. O

In O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
amazing O
scene O
, O
Mr. O
Macmillan B-PERSON
waved O
his O
hand O
at O
Mr. O
Fell B-PERSON
. O

This O
seemed O
to O
infuriate O
Mr. O
Fell B-PERSON
even O
more O
. O

" O
I O
cannot O
be O
told O
to O
sit O
down O
by O
the O
Prime O
Minister O
. O

" O
Protests O
had O
been O
expected O
from O
Tory B-ORGANIZATION
rebels O
. O

But O
Mr. O
Fell's B-PERSON
attack O
was O
unprecedented O
. O

He O
accused O
the O
Prime O
Minister O
of O
" O
political O
double O
talk O
. O

" O
" O
It O
had O
the O
effect O
on O
one B-CARDINAL
former O
supporter O
that O
he O
now O
thinks O
this O
Prime O
Minister O
is O
a O
national O
disaster O
, O
" O
he O
said O
. O

Most O
MPs O
agreed O
that O
Mr. O
Fell's B-PERSON
attack O
had O
, O
if O
anything O
, O
rallied O
support O
to O
the O
Prime O
Minister O
. O

This O
apparently O
, O
was O
Mr. O
Macmillan's B-PERSON
assessment O
. O

He O
confined O
his O
reply O
to O
the O
observation O
that O
Mr. O
Fell B-PERSON
had O
probably O
" O
maximised O
his O
support O
. O

" O
There O
were O
no O
other O
attacks O
of O
such O
ferocity O
. O

But O
there O
was O
ample O
evidence O
of O
Conservative B-ORGANIZATION
and O
Labour B-ORGANIZATION
opposition O
, O
which O
will O
be O
aired O
in O
the O
debate O
tomorrow B-TIME
and O
on O
Thursday B-TIME
. O

As O
Mr. O
Macmillan B-PERSON
made O
his O
announcement O
, O
the O
House B-ORGANIZATION
was O
crowded O
. O

He O
said O
: O
" O
No O
 O
British B-ORGANIZATION

join O

" O
Near O
the O
end O
of O
a O
long O
statement O
, O
Mr. O
Macmillan B-PERSON
stated O
the O
Government's B-ORGANIZATION
intention O
: O
" O
After O
long O
and O
earnest O
consideration O
, O
Her B-ORGANIZATION

have O
come O
to O
the O
conclusion O
that O
it O

make O
a O

application O

for O

" O
At O
this O
point O
, O
Mr. O
Paul B-PERSON
Williams I-PERSON
( O

called O
out O
" O
Shame O

" O
Mr. O
Williams B-PERSON
is O
a O
close O
associate O
of O
Mr. O
Fell B-PERSON
. O

He O
claimed O
that O
, O
unless O
we O
were O

the O
Common B-ORGANIZATION
Market I-ORGANIZATION
, O
we O
should O
not O
be O
able O

its O

" O
We O
can O
lead O
better O
from O

" O
he O
said O
. O

Mr. O
Macmillan B-PERSON
dealt O
with O
the O
main O
objection O
raised O
by O
Tory B-ORGANIZATION
critics O
. O

Mr. O
Anthony B-PERSON
Fell I-PERSON
, O
who O
created O
a O
scene O
on O
this O
point O
on O
Monday B-TIME
, O
took O
up O
a O
position O
almost O
hidden O
behind O
the O
Serjeant O
at O
Arms' O
chair O
. O

Mr. O
Macmillan B-PERSON
said O
we O
could O
be O
more O
help O
to O
the O
Commonwealth B-ORGANIZATION
through O
the O
strength O
we O
would O
gain O
in O
the O
Common B-ORGANIZATION
Market I-ORGANIZATION
than O
by O
isolation O
. O

He O
paid O
tribute O
to O
the O
development O
of O
the O
Common B-ORGANIZATION
Market I-ORGANIZATION
. O

" O
The O
Community B-ORGANIZATION
( O
Common B-ORGANIZATION

has O
imparted O
an O
impetus O
and O
an O
economic O
growth O
to O
The O
Six B-CARDINAL
. O

Above O
all O
, O
it O
is O
an O
idea O
which O
has O
gripped O
men's O
minds O
, O
" O
he O
said O
. O

Referring O
to O
previous O
negotiations O
, O
Mr. O
Macmillan B-PERSON
looked O
towards O
Mr. O
Reginald B-PERSON
Maudling I-PERSON
. O

" O
These O
were O
negotiations O
in O
which O
the O
President O
of O
the O
Board B-ORGANIZATION
of I-ORGANIZATION
Trade I-ORGANIZATION
played O
a O
conspicuous O
part O
, O
" O
the O
Premier O
said O
. O

He O
dismissed O
the O
idea O
that O
Britain B-LOCATION
would O
be O
swamped O
by O
cheap O
labour O
. O

Our O

, O
he O
said O
, O
would O

" O
Many O
people O
feel O
we O
have O
had O
, O
perhaps O
, O
too O
much O
shelter O
, O
" O
he O
went O
on O

Conservatives B-NORP
protested O
when O
Mr. O
Gaitskell B-PERSON
said O
he O
had O
been O
told O
this O
" O
by O
some O
 O
people O
of O
considerable O
authority O
, O
" O
he O
retorted O
. O

" O
I O
agree O
with O
the O
Prime O

that O
I O
do O
not O
think O
we O
are O
necessarily O

federalism O
in O

" O
he O
went O
on O

If O
we O
joined O
the O
Common B-ORGANIZATION

our O
food O

would O
probably O
be O

out O
in O

as O
we O

Will O
it O
end O

Africa's I-LOCATION
exclusion O

The O
issue O

is O
a O
possibility O
that O

actually O

But O
if O
a O

decision O
is O
to O

now O
, O
on O
which O
side O
do O
the O
strongest O
arguments O
lie O
? O

THE O
Archbishop O
of O
Capetown B-LOCATION
has O
shown O
that O
the O
matter O
is O
not O
clear-cut O
. O

The O
Archbishop O
has O
long O
been O
a O
courageous O
fighter O
against O
apartheid O
. O

He O
must O
be O
heard O
with O
attention O
. O

On O
purely O
practical O
grounds O
he O
holds O
that O
it O
would O
be O
a O
mistake O
to O
expel O
South B-LOCATION
Africa I-LOCATION
, O
weakening O
the O
whites O
who O
are O
working O
for O
a O
change O
of O
policy O
. O

In O
his O
view O
it O
would O
also O
be O
against O
the O
interests O
of O
the O
Africans B-NORP
. O

He O
holds O
that O
more O
pressure O
can O
be O
put O
on O
South B-LOCATION
Africa I-LOCATION
while O
she O
remains O
in O
the O
Commonwealth B-ORGANIZATION

could O
be O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
those O
who O
favour O
expulsion O

inclu- O
ding O
African B-NORP
leaders O
, O
feel O
that O
nothing O
less O
than O
the O
shock O
of O
expulsion O
will O
weaken O
the O
grip O
of O
Dr. O
Verwoerd B-PERSON

the O
Nationalists B-NORP

They O
point O
out O
that O
Dr. O
Verwoerd B-PERSON
refuses O
to O
consider O
abandoning O
the O
apartheid O
policy O

THE O
Commonwealth B-ORGANIZATION
is O
a O
multi-racial O
society O

A O
policy O
of O
racial O
discrimination O
in O
any O
of O
its O
countries O
is O
surely O
the O
one B-CARDINAL
thing O
that O
it O
could O
not O
survive O
. O

Whatever O
statesmen O
say O
at O
the O

table O
in O
London B-LOCATION
, O
millions B-CARDINAL
at O

would O
regard O
as O
fraudulent O
a O
Commonwealth B-ORGANIZATION
which O
had O
room O
for O
a O
racist O
South B-LOCATION

And O
this O
is O
a O
Commonwealth B-ORGANIZATION

five B-CARDINAL

Seen O
in O
this O
wider O
picture O
, O
a O
South B-LOCATION
Africa I-LOCATION
that O
clings O
to O

a O
menace O

A O
practical O
solution O
would O
be O
for O
the O
Commonwealth B-ORGANIZATION
to O
draft O
a O
set O
of O
principles O
excluding O
race O
discrimination O
. O

And O
so O
leave O
South B-LOCATION
Africa I-LOCATION
to O
make O
the O

or O
go O
out O

THE O
Queen O
and O
the O
Duke O
of O
Edinburgh B-LOCATION
come O
home O
tonight B-TIME
from O
their O
tour O
in O
the O
East B-LOCATION
. O

The O
duke's O
trigger-finger O
and O
the O
ritual O
slaughter O
of O
beasts O
have O
taken O
the O
headlines O
in O
this O
country O
. O

Nevertheless O
, O
the O
tour O
has O
been O
an O
immense O
success O
. O

The O
Queen O
has O
won O
a O
triumph O
. O

It O
would O
be O
pleasanter O
if O
such O
cruel O
and O
feudal O
performances O
as O
tiger O
and O
rhino O
hunts O
were O
dropped O
from O
future O
Royal O
programmes O
. O

But O
the O
Queen O
and O
the O
Duke O
have O
pleased O
millions B-CARDINAL
by O
their O
visit O
. O

The O
warmth O
of O
their O
welcome O
in O
India B-LOCATION
and O
Pakistan B-LOCATION
are O
happy O
memories O
. O

WEST B-LOCATION
GERMANY I-LOCATION
- O
followed O
yesterday B-TIME
by O
the O
Dutch B-NORP
- O
has O
made O
the O
gesture O
of O
a O
good O
neighbour O
. O

She O
has O
put O
up O
the O
value O
of O
her O
money O
. O

Certainly O
, O
the O
rise O
is O
very O
small O
. O

But O
it O
is O
a O
step O
in O
the O
direction O
of O
live-and-let-live O
. O

Hopes O
will O
now O
grow O
brighter O
of O
further O
international O
co-operation O
, O
which O
is O
the O
only O
way O
to O
solve O
the O
payments O
difficulties O
that O
upset O
the O
Western B-NORP
world O
. O

Britain B-LOCATION
and O
the O
U.S. B-LOCATION
, O
which O
have O
problems O
with O
their O
balances O
, O
will O
gain O
some O
immediate O
help O
. O

What O
it O
means O
in O
practical O
terms O
is O
that O
our O
exports O
to O
Germany B-LOCATION
will O
now O
be O
a O
little O
cheaper O
for O
Germans B-NORP
to O
buy O
, O
while O
the O
goods O
which O
Germany B-LOCATION
exports O
will O
be O
made O
a O
little O
dearer O
. O

Booming O
Germany B-LOCATION
is O
deliberately O
encouraging O
more O
imports O
as O
a O
means O
to O
curb O
rising O
prices O
at O
home O
. O

She O
is O
also O
aware O
how O
 O
unpopular O
she O
has O
been O
growing O
by O
failing O
until O
now O
to O
co-operate O
as O
a O
creditor O
nation O
should O
. O

Germany B-LOCATION
exports O
much O
more O
than O
she O
imports O
. O

For O
upwards B-TIME
of I-TIME
five I-TIME
years I-TIME
the O
world's O
reserves O
of O
dollars O
have O
been O
drained O
into O
Germany B-LOCATION
. O

There O
they O
have O
stayed O
uselessly O
locked O
up O
because O
Germany B-LOCATION
has O
no O
tradition O
of O
trading O
abroad O
. O

In O
addition O
the O
strength O
of O
Germany's B-LOCATION
trading O
position O
has O
attracted O
speculators O
to O
hold O
marks O
rather O
than O
pounds O
or O
dollars O
, O
hoping O
for O
the O
mark O
to O
rise O
, O
as O
has O
now O
happened O
. O

WILL O
the O
new O
valuation O
be O
enough O
to O
correct O
Germany's B-LOCATION
massive O
trading O
surplus O
and O
choke O
off O
speculation O
against O
dollar O
and O
pound O
? O

That O
is O
doubtful O
. O

If O
however O
, O
in O
addition O
to O
her O
new O
good-neighbour O
gesture O
, O
Germany B-LOCATION
takes O
a O
really O
big O
share O
in O
giving O
aid O
to O
underdeveloped O
nations O
, O
the O
world O
outlook O
will O
be O
brighter O
. O

What O
gives O
rise O
to O
optimism O
is O
the O
sign O
that O
Germany B-LOCATION
and O
the O
other O
leading O
Western B-NORP
nations O
are O
at O
long O
last O
moving O
towards O
a O
solution O
of O
currency O
problems O
by O
co-operation O

A O
CURIOUS O
advertisement O
on O
page O
nine B-CARDINAL
, O
paid O
for O
by O
that O
curious O
body O
Moral B-ORGANIZATION
Re-Armament I-ORGANIZATION
. O

Those O
who O
lend O
their O
names O
to O
this O
kind O
of O
advertisement O
are O
worthy O
people O
, O
a O
little O
innocent O
of O
politics O
, O
perhaps O
, O
or O
carried O
away O
by O
the O
idea O
that O
moral O
regeneration O
would O
solve O
all O
our O
problems O
. O

So O
it O
would O
. O

While O
we O
are O
waiting O
for O
the O
millenium B-TIME
, O
however O
, O
most O
of O
us O
would O
prefer O
to O
put O
our O
hopes O
for O
earthly O
justice O
in O
instruments O
of O
democracy O
, O
such O
as O
trade O
unions O
and O
our O
local O
and O
national O
Parliaments B-ORGANIZATION
. O

Should O
the O
Herald B-ORGANIZATION
publish O
such O
advertisements O
? O

This O
is O
a O
difficult O
question O
. O

It O
would O
obviously O
be O
wrong O
to O
refuse O
all O
political O
advertisements O
with O
which O
we O
disagree O
. O

When O
an O
advertisement O
contains O
statements O
whose O
factual O
truth O
is O
doubtful O
, O
or O
where O
the O
total O
content O
would O
be O
deeply O
repugnant O
to O
our O
readers O
, O
it O
is O
right O
to O
exercise O
editorial O
discretion O
. O

The O
MRA B-ORGANIZATION
advertisement O
falls O
into O
neither O
category O
, O
though O
many O
readers O
will O
dislike O
it O
. O

The O
first B-CARDINAL
reaction O
of O
the O
Sudanese B-ORGANIZATION
Government I-ORGANIZATION
was O
to O
denounce O
the O
United B-ORGANIZATION
Nations I-ORGANIZATION
for O
" O
negligence O
and O
impotence O
, O
" O
and O
to O
say O
that O
its O
400 B-CARDINAL
troops O
in O
the O
Congo B-LOCATION
would O
be O
taken O
home O
. O

The O
reaction O
can O
be O
understood O
. O

The O
Sudan's B-LOCATION
concern O
for O
its O
men O
is O
natural O
. O

But O
this O
could O
hardly O
be O
a O
 O
dignified O
exit O
. O

IF O
the O
UN B-ORGANIZATION
is O
blamed O
for O
being O
weak O
, O
it O
would O
be O
more O
logical O
to O
send O
in O
more O
men O
, O
not O
weaken O
it O
further O
by O
desertion O
. O

It O
is O
unjust O
to O
pass O
the O
buck O
to O
Mr. O
Hammarskjold B-PERSON
and O
the O
UN's B-ORGANIZATION
servants O
. O

The O
responsibility O
rightly O
belongs O
to O
the O
nations O
which O
have O
undertaken O
the O
task O
of O
pre- O
serving O
peace O
in O
the O
Congo B-LOCATION
. O

That O
is O
not O
a O
ceremonial O
duty O
, O
and O
the O
soldiers O
have O
every O
right O
to O
blame O
the O
politicians O
unless O
they O
see O
it O
through O
. O

When O
the O
United B-ORGANIZATION
Nations I-ORGANIZATION
instructed O
Mr. O
Hammarskjold B-PERSON
to O
use O
force O
if O
necessary O
to O
prevent O
civil O
war O
, O
it O
was O
clear O
that O
new O
dangers O
would O
arise O
unless O
it O
gave O
him O
the O
political O
... O
That O
was O
the O
first B-CARDINAL
point O
that O
Mr. O
Hammarskjold B-PERSON
made O
. O

India B-LOCATION
has O
responded O
handsomely O
by O
providing O
3,000 B-CARDINAL
men O
, O
who O
must O
take O
about B-TIME
a I-TIME
fortnight I-TIME
to O
arrive O
. O

If O
the O
UN B-ORGANIZATION
forces O
were O
thick O
enough O
on O
the O
ground O
, O
such O
incidents O
as O
that O
at O
Matadi B-LOCATION
would O
not O
happen O
. O

THE O
UN's B-ORGANIZATION
ability O
to O
keep O
peace O
depends O
simply O
on O
adequate O
support O
by O
the O
nations O
which O
have O
set O
their O
hands O
to O
this O
plough O
. O

The O
big O
Powers O
involved O
in O
the O
Cold O
War O
must O
of O
course O
keep O
out O
. O

The O
Americans B-NORP
were O
justified O
in O
diverting O
naval O
ships O
in O
case O
non-combatant O
help O
was O
wanted O
; O
but O
they O
stressed O
that O
there O
was O
no O
intention O
to O
intervene O
in O
fighting O
. O

Yesterday B-TIME
the O
ships O
turned O
away O
again O
, O
satisfied O
that O
they O
were O
not O
required O
. O

It O
is O
to O
be O
hoped O
that O
the O
UN B-ORGANIZATION
will O
be O
re-established O
in O
their O
port O
by O
negotiation O
and O
that O
there O
will O
be O
no O
more O
outrages O
. O

But O
back O
, O
Mr. O
Hammarskjold B-PERSON
is O
determined O
, O
they O
must O
go O
. O

The O
best O
news O
for O
the O
Congo B-LOCATION
would O
be O
agreement O
between O
its O
rival O
political O
leaders O
. O

Through O
the O
patient O
efforts O
of O
UN B-ORGANIZATION
conciliators O
they O
are O
meeting O
for O
the O
first B-CARDINAL
time O
, O
in O
Malagasy B-LOCATION
( O
formerly O
Madagascar B-LOCATION
) O
. O

THE O
world O
will O
sigh O
with O
relief O
when O
this O
strife-torn O
land O
gets O
itself O
a O
government O
which O
all O
outsiders O
can O
recognise O
. O

ONLY O
a O
man O
wrapped O
in O
the O
impenetrable O
cocoon O
of O
what O
he O
regards O
as O
a O
divine O
mission O
could O
have O
spoken O
of O
apartheid O
as O
" O
a O
policy O
of O
good O
neighbourliness O
. O

" O
We O
may O
be O
sure O
that O
he O
is O
not O
being O
hypocritical O
. O

That O
is O
what O
he O
really O
believes O
. O

A O
good O
neighbour O
to O
those O
Africans B-NORP
who O
, O
under O
apartheid O
, O
will O
be O
forced O
back O
to O
their O
tribal O
reserves O
with O
no O
prospect O
but O
a O
cramped O
and O
primitive O
existence O
. O

A O
good O
neighbour O
to O
those O
Africans B-NORP
who O
will O
con- O
tinue O
to O
live O
as O
hewers O
of O
wood O
and O
drawers O
of O
water O
in O
the O
white O
areas O
of O
South B-LOCATION
Africa I-LOCATION
, O
without O
rights O
and O
without O
hope O
. O

THE O
same O
sort O
of O
good O
neighbour O
that O
he O
proved O
to O
be O
to O
the O
Jews B-NORP
fleeing O
from O
Hitler B-PERSON
in O
the B-TIME
thirties I-TIME
. O

It O
was O
Dr. O
Verwoerd B-PERSON
who O
led O
a O
protest O
against O
admitting O
any O
of O
them O
because O
they O
would O
" O
defile O
" O
the O
national O
white O
stock O
. O

It O
is O
impossible O
to O
make O
contact O
with O
Dr. O
Ver- B-PERSON
woerd I-PERSON
in O
his O
nightmare O
world O
. O

It O
is O
this O
that O
makes O
illusory O
any O
hopes O
that O
he O
may O
be O
in- O
fluenced O
to O
change O
course O
. O

The O
Archbishop O
of O
Capetown B-LOCATION
, O
Dr. O
Joost B-PERSON
de I-PERSON
Blank I-PERSON
, O
has O
pleaded O
that O
South B-LOCATION
Africa I-LOCATION
should O
be O
allowed O
to O
stay O
in O
the O
Commonwealth B-ORGANIZATION
. O

Otherwise O
, O
he O
says O
, O
those O
inside O
the O
country O
who O
still O
oppose O
apartheid O
will O
be O
left O
even O
more O
isolated O
and O
alone O
. O

The O
views O
of O
the O
Archbishop O
, O
who O
has O
maintained O
an O
unflinching O
witness O
to O
what O
Christianity B-ORGANIZATION
really O
means O
, O
must O
carry O
weight O
. O

But O
what O
, O
in O
fact O
, O
can O
the O
other O
Commonwealth B-ORGANIZATION
countries O
do O
to O
bring O
support O
and O
comfort O
to O
this O
gallant O
minority O
? O

THERE O
is O
no O
evidence O
that O
the O
policy O
of O
appeasement O
has O
modified O
the O
actions O
of O
the O
Nationalists B-NORP
. O

On O
the O
contrary O
, O
apartheid O
is O
being O
applied O
ever O
more O
ruthlessly O
. O

The O
shock O
of O
expulsion O
from O
the O
Commonwealth B-ORGANIZATION
now O
seems O
to O
be O
the O
only O
way O
left O
to O
try O
to O
bring O
home O
to O
the O
people O
of O
South B-LOCATION
Africa I-LOCATION
that O
Dr. O
Verwoerd B-PERSON
is O
leading O
them O
to O
disaster O
. O

It O
may O
be O
that O
the O
Commonwealth B-ORGANIZATION
Prime O
Ministers O
will O
decide O
against O
this O
final O
step O
. O

If O
that O
is O
their O
decision O
they O
should O
also O
go O
unequivocally O
on O
record O
that O
they O
regard O
apartheid O
as O
evil O
and O
indefensible O
. O

Unless O
they O
do O
at O
least O
that O
, O
Dr. O
Verwoerd B-PERSON
will O
be O
able O
to O
return O
home O
claiming O
a O
triumph O

His O

be O
blander O

WE O

when O
the O

hardly O

without O
a O

or O
a O

or O
probably O
both O

about O
the O

What O
seems O
certain O
is O
that O
those O
who O
advocate O
putting O
off O
any O
approach O
until O
Mr O
Krushchev B-PERSON
gives O
evidence O
of O
a O
change O
of O
heart O
( O
whatever O
that O
may O

) O
would O
have O
us O
run O
risks O
greater O
than O
the O
West B-LOCATION

to O
run O
- O
and O
greater O
than O
President O

most O
influential O

seem O
disposed O
to O
face O
. O

The O
real O
question O
is O
what O
we O
should O
put O
to O
the O
Soviet B-ORGANIZATION
Government I-ORGANIZATION
as O
a O
basis O
for O
talks O
: O
and O
On O
this O
reading O
what O
Mr. O
Gollancz B-PERSON
calls O
manoeuvring O
, O
and O
what O
we O
should O
call O
cool-headed O
and O
inventive O
negotiation O
, O
is O
a O
means O
not O
to O
destruction O
but O
to O
safety O
. O

The O
Government's B-ORGANIZATION
pompous O
little O
statement O
on O
Northern B-LOCATION
Rhodesia I-LOCATION
does O
not O
say O
much O
, O
but O
it O
says O
what O
is O
necessary O
- O
that O
the O
Northern B-LOCATION
Rhodesia I-LOCATION
Constitution O
is O
open O
to O
revision O
. O

This O
is O
news O
, O
however O
much O
the O
Government B-ORGANIZATION
tries O
to O
disguise O
it O
by O
saying O
that O
the O
revision O
would O
be O
Formula O
One B-CARDINAL
, O
which O
appeared O
in O
February B-TIME
, O
appeared O
to O
make O
this O
likely O
; O
Formula O
Two B-CARDINAL
, O
which O
appeared O
in O
June B-TIME
, O
made O
it O
very O
unlikely O
; O
if O
Formula O

restores O
the O
original O
principle O
, O
that O
is O
all O
that O
need O
be O
required O
of O
it O
. O

It O
is O
a O
pity O
that O
the O
Government B-ORGANIZATION
should O
ever O
have O
been O
led O
away O
from O
this O
principle O
. O

It O
is O
a O
great O
pity O
that O
the O
Government B-ORGANIZATION
should O
give O
the O
appearance O
of O
responding O
, O
not O
to O
Mr O
Kaunda's B-PERSON
reasonable O
representations O
, O
but O
to O
the O
violence O
which O
he O

say O
" O
New B-LOCATION

To O
Germany's B-LOCATION
Western B-NORP

the O

has O
been O
a O

It O

What O
the O

it O

The O

SIR O

SUTTON I-PERSON
, O
however O

made O
no O

about O
it O
yesterday B-TIME

The O
purpose O
is O
to O
give O

The O

have O

It O
is O
true O
that O
SIR O

there O

" O
an O

This O

The O
ordinary O
British B-NORP
man O

conscious O

Rather O

fifty B-CARDINAL

of O
50,000 B-CARDINAL

there O
any O
reason O
why O
the O
centigrade O
countries O
should O
not O
change O
to O
fahrenheit O
? O

Can O
it O
be O
shown O
that O
the O
one O
scale O
is O
demon- O
strably O
better O
than O
the O
other O
? O

The O
centigraders O
may O
be O
in O
for O
a O
stiffer O
fight O

they O

They O
may O
have O
to O
call O
up O

Even O
then O
it O
might O
be O
easier O
to O
persuade O
the O
British B-NORP
public O
to O
go O
over O
to O
decimal O

- O
in O
certain O
circumstances O
the O
time O
would O
come O
when O
this O

suit O

rather O

to O

In O

Once O

Because O

Eighteen B-TIME

And O
as O
the O

the O

so O
the O

stepped O
up O

TODAY B-TIME

Not O
content O
with O
arguing O
that O

" O
He O
feels O
like O
Pontius B-PERSON
Pilate I-PERSON
who O
washed O
his O

saying O
: O
" O

" O
Like O
Dr. O

, O
whom O
I O
interviewed O
the O

Eichmann B-PERSON

" O
Eichmann B-PERSON

on O
dangerous O

pleads O

led O
to O

He O
understood O
the O

an O

used O
it O
with O

The O
appalling O
thing O
about O
the O

that O

the O
German B-NORP

" O
Later B-TIME

breaking O
the O

and O
added O
: O
" O
Without O
Britain's B-LOCATION

German B-NORP

At O

Yesterday B-TIME
West B-NORP
German I-NORP
Defence O
Minister O
, O
Herr O

, O
started O
talks O
with O
the O
British B-NORP
Defence O
Minister O
, O
Mr. O
Watkinson B-PERSON

Their O
talks O
are O
another O
stage O

the O

1961 B-TIME
variety O
, O
by O
which O
the O
West B-NORP
German I-NORP
militarists O
are O
advancing O
their O

. O

Herr O
Strauss B-PERSON
told O
the O
Daily B-ORGANIZATION

last B-TIME
October I-TIME
that O
his O
policy O
was O
to O
make O
his O
country O
the O
" O

in O
Europe B-LOCATION
and O
the O
United B-LOCATION

principal O

" O
His O
job O
is O
to O
build O

back O
West B-LOCATION

He O
continued O
this B-TIME

the O
argument O
with O
Mr. O
Watkinson B-PERSON
which O
he O
had O
in O
public O
at O
a O
Nato B-ORGANIZATION
council O
meeting O
last B-TIME

over O
the O
question O
: O
do O
we O
fight O
a O
30-day B-TIME

or O
a O
90-day B-TIME
war O
? O

A O
90-day B-TIME
war O
, O
the O
West B-NORP
German I-NORP
view O
, O
provides O
the O
pretext O
for O
huge O
German B-NORP
armed O
forces O
( O
within O
Nato B-ORGANIZATION
of O

) O
and O
for O
those O
to O

all O

In O
the O
past B-TIME

West B-LOCATION

has O
secured O
agreements O

in O
France B-LOCATION

After O
much O
bargaining O
the O
British B-ORGANIZATION
Government I-ORGANIZATION
has O
agreed O
to O
give O
similar O

The O
process O
has O
been O
too O
slow O
for O
Herr O
Strauss B-PERSON

attacked O

these O
divisions O
a O

of O
over B-CARDINAL
600 I-CARDINAL

provided O
by O

These O

are O
in O

could O
launch O

By O
1963 B-TIME
the O
Germans B-NORP
plan O

with O
288 B-CARDINAL

36 B-CARDINAL

also O
provided O

Last B-TIME
month I-TIME
West B-LOCATION
Germany I-LOCATION
was O
reported O
to O
be O
halfway O
toward O
this O

Her O
position O
as O
" O
America's B-LOCATION
principal O

" O
grows O
stronger O

stronger O
. O

Now O
this O
target O
which O
Herr O
Strauss B-PERSON
and O
his O
fellows O
have O
their O
eyes O
on O
is O
control O
of O
the O
warheads O
to O

General O
Heusinger B-PERSON
, O
the O
man O
who O
caused O
a O
great O
disturbance O
last B-TIME
autumn I-TIME
All O
this O
has O
been O
achieved O
through O
Nato B-ORGANIZATION
under O
American B-NORP
leadership O
. O

But O
a O
big O
role O
has O
been O
played O
not O
only O
by O
the O
British B-ORGANIZATION
Government I-ORGANIZATION
but O
by O
Right-Wing B-ORGANIZATION
Labour I-ORGANIZATION
in O
this O
country O
. O

They O
have O
helped O
build O
up O
Nato B-ORGANIZATION
and O
rearm O
Western B-LOCATION
Germany I-LOCATION
, O
in O
pursuit O
of O
the O
old O
familiar O
anti-Soviet B-NORP
policy O
which O
brought O
disaster O
in O
1939 B-TIME
. O

Now O
the O
argument O
is O
being O
used O
that O
Nato B-ORGANIZATION
must O
be O
maintained O
and O
Britain B-LOCATION
must O
stay O
in O
it O
to O
keep O
the O
Germans B-NORP
in O
control O
. O

Nato B-ORGANIZATION
, O
far O
from O
being O
a O
means O
of O
controlling O
the O
German B-NORP
militarists O
, O
is O
, O
in O
fact O
, O
the O
cover O
for O
building O
up O
their O
power O
. O

What O
must O
Britain B-LOCATION
do O
? O

Today B-TIME
, O
again O
, O
she O
has O
a O
key O
role O
. O

Let O
her O
tell O
men O
like O
Strauss B-PERSON
that O
he O
shall O
have O
no O
bases O
or O

" O
no O

in O
his O
quest O
for O

A O
policy O
which O
breaks O
with O
military O
alliances O
like O
Nato B-ORGANIZATION
and O
seeks O
friendship O
with O
the O

Camp- I-PERSON

article O
, O
for O
, O
as O
president O
of O
a O
union O
which O
fought O
for O
and O
still O
stands O
on O
the O
policy O
decisions O
established O
at O
the O
Scar- B-LOCATION
borough I-LOCATION
Labour B-ORGANIZATION
Party I-ORGANIZATION
Conference O
I O
am O
appalled O
at O
the O
character O
of O
the O
current O
For O
many B-TIME
years I-TIME
my O
union O
had O
to O
present O
its O
views O
to O
the O
two B-CARDINAL
major O
conferences O
of O
the O
movement O
and O
take O
a O
licking O
. O

For O
us O
, O
unity O
meant O
accepting O
unpalatable O
majority O
decisions O
as O
binding O
on O
the O
movement O
and O
having O
a O
go O
next O
time O
. O

Alongside O
many O
others O
, O
we O
conducted O
our O
fight O
by O
putting O
down O
 O
unambiguous O
alternatives O
to O
official O
policy O
and O
seeking O
to O
win O
majorities O
for O
them O
. O

When O
Scarborough B-LOCATION
carried O
our O
point O
of O
view O
we O
were O
naturally O
delighted O
, O
more O
so O
because O
the O
alternatives O
had O
been O
put O
clearly O
to O
the O
movement O
, O
which O
had O
then O
chosen O
a O
vigorous O
anti-Nato B-NORP
, O
anti-Tory B-NORP
, O
anti-bomb B-NORP
and O
anti-German B-NORP
rearmament O
policy O
. O

Hopes O
rose O
as O
we O
saw O
a O
perspective O
of O
sharp O
struggle O
based O
on O
consistent O
lines O
of O
difference O
with O
the O
Tories B-NORP
. O

Many O
members O
understood O
that O
the O
bread-and-butter O
struggles O
of O
the O
union O
would O
become O
easier O
in O
the O
context O
For O
we O
have O
always O
felt O
, O
even O
if O
we O
have O
then O
by O
our O
practice O
ignored O
it O
, O
the O
inconsistency O
between O
support O
for O
the O
war O
alliance O
, O
with O
resulting O
colossal O
spending O
on O
armaments O
, O
and O
our O
basic O
effort O
to O
improve O
living O
standards O
. O

Instead O
, O
we O
saw O
the O
Gaitskellites B-NORP
using O
the O
position O
of O
organisational O
dominance O
established O
during O
their O
years O
They O
obstructed O
every O
effort O
to O
fight O
for O
the O
Scarborough B-LOCATION
decisions O
, O
while O
 O
scratching O
around O
frantically O
to O
overturn O
them O
next O
time O
. O

Confusion O
of O
the O
original O
issue O
by O
misrepresentation O
of O
the O
decisions O
, O
the O
introduction O
of O
a O
pseudo O
third B-CARDINAL
way O
and O
the O
call O
for O
party O
unity O
- O
in O
effect O
, O
a O
demand O
that O
the O
movement O
unite O
with O
the O
Gaitskellites B-NORP
on O
their O
policy O
and O
no O
other O
seems O
to O
have O
done O
the O
trick O
of O
moving O
a O
number O
of O
unions O
It O
would O
become O
easy O
to O
become O
cynical O
and O
to O
despair O
. O

And O
yet O
, O
wherever O
the O
issues O
were O
put O
clearly O
, O
sections O
of O
the O
movement O
reaffirmed O
their O
original O
stand O
. O

Only O
where O
the O
issues O
were O
posed O
so O
as O
to O
cause O
doubt O
and O
confusion O
were O
positions O
lost O
. O

It O
is O
my O
view O
that O
this O
immediate O
confusion O
hides O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
Peace B-ORGANIZATION
movement I-ORGANIZATION
is O
still O
advancing O
and O
that O
clarification O
of O
the O
issues O
can O
bring O
a O
majority O
to O
 O
secure O
the O
Scarborough B-LOCATION
decisions O
. O

Powerful O
units O
have O
stood O
firm O
. O

In O
unions O
where O
the O
central O
issues O
were O
confused O
, O
clear O
policy O
details O
- O
as O
on O
bases O
- O
were O
decisively O
carried O

This O
, O

the O
numbers O

active O
workers O
who O
are O
beginning O
to O
understand O
how O
and O
why O
the O
trick O
was O
done O
, O
provides O
a O
strong O
, O
immediate O
basis O
for O
a O
campaign O
against O
weak O
and O
doubtful O
positions O
, O
and O
for O
a O
consistent O
peace O
policy O
. O

All O
recent O
events O
show O
how O
correct O
the O
Scarborough B-LOCATION

were O
. O

The O
Kennedy B-ORGANIZATION

and O
the O
kite-flying O
on O

present O
a O
whole O
new O
proof O
that O
to O
abandon O
Scarborough B-LOCATION
is O
to O
expose O
Britain B-LOCATION
and O
her O
working O
class O
to O
sharp O
new O
dangers O
- O
that O
Gaitskellism O
is O
bankrupt O
. O

Ordinary O

will O
never O
rally O
to O

a O

on O

chicanery O
or O
elect O

Gaitskell's B-PERSON
stupid O

The O
tragedy O
is O
that O
enormous O
inroads O
could O
already O
have O
been O
made O
into O

strength O
by O
a O
fighting O
policy O
, O
based O
on O
Scarborough B-LOCATION

THE O
desire O
for O
unity O
in O

movement O
following O
the O
At O
the O

time O
that O

cannot O
be O
established O
on O
a O
false O
basis O
, O
or O
by O
creating O
further O
confusion O
within O
the O

Unity O
will O
never O
be O
established O
on O
the O
basis O
of O

being O
a O
law O
unto O
themselves O
and O
opposing O

when O
it O
suits O
their O

convenience O

Unity O
can O
never O
be O
established O

formula O
uniting O
those O
who O
oppose O
German B-NORP
troops O
being O
trained O

soil O
and O

, O
and O
those O
who O
are O
for O
this O
policy O
- O
which O
is O
the O
same O
as O
that O
of O
the O
Tory B-ORGANIZATION
Government I-ORGANIZATION
. O

It O
is O
impossible O
for O
Labour's B-ORGANIZATION
new O
Defence O
state- O
ment O
to O
unite O
the O
movement O
as O
the O
Labour B-ORGANIZATION
leaders O
are O
not O
only O
in O
favour O
of O
American B-NORP
bases O
, O
but O
are O
in O
favour O
of O
German B-NORP

The O
new O
Defence O
statement O
, O
while O
accepting O
that O
Britain B-LOCATION
can- O
not O
remain O
an O
independent O
nuclear O
Power O
, O
now O
supports O
the O
policy O
of O
depending O
on O
American B-NORP
nuclear O
weapons O
and O
the O
H-bomb O
, O
placing O
Britain B-LOCATION
in O
an O
even O
more O
dangerous O
position O
. O

The O
statement O
of O
Padley B-PERSON
and O
Crossman B-PERSON
is O
no O
different O
in O
principle O
to O
the O
new O
defence O
statement O
. O

They O
accept O
American B-NORP
nuclear O
bases O
, O
and O
also O
the O
use O
of O
nuclear O
weapons O
and O
nuclear O
strategy O
until O
some O
future O
date O
. O

They O
deceive O
the O
people O
by O
their O
talk O
of O
political O
and O
collective O
control O
of O
Nato B-ORGANIZATION
. O

The O
Pentagon B-ORGANIZATION
has O
made O
it O
perfectly O
clear O
who O
controls O
the O
American B-NORP
H-bomb O
, O
and O
who O
will O
actually O
give O
the O
instructions O
to O
press O
the O
button O
for O
nuclear O
warfare O
. O

There O
is O
only O
one B-CARDINAL
way O
to O
develop O
unity O
and O
at O
the O
same O
time O
defend O
Britain B-LOCATION
. O

This O
was O
shown O
at O
the O
Scottish B-ORGANIZATION
Trades I-ORGANIZATION
Union I-ORGANIZATION
Congress I-ORGANIZATION
, O
representing O
800,000 B-CARDINAL
organised O
trade O
unionists O
, O
when O
it O
decided O
by O
overwhelming O
votes O
, O
to O
reaffirm O
the O
Scarborough B-LOCATION
decisions O
on O
unilateral O
disarmament O
, O
and O
to O
oppose O
Polaris O
and O
military O
bases O
being O
installed O
on O
the O
Holy B-LOCATION
Loch I-LOCATION
, O
or O
any O
other O
part O
of O
Britain B-LOCATION
. O

Such O
a O
policy O
would O
unite O
the O
whole O
movement O
and O
lay O
the O
basis O
for O
the O
defeat O
of O
the O
present O
Tory B-ORGANIZATION
Government I-ORGANIZATION
, O
which O
has O
become O
a O
real O
menace O
to O
the O
British B-NORP
people O
both O
in O
home O
and O
foreign O
policy O
. O

It O
is O
quite O
evident O
that O
the O
movement O
will O
go O
on O
record O
against O
the O
Polaris O
base O
and O
facilities O
for O
German B-NORP
bases O
and O
military O
training O
. O

This O
should O
strengthen O
the O
campaign O
to O
end O
the O
manufacture O
and O
use O
of O
nuclear O
weapons O
in O
Britain B-LOCATION
. O

Britain B-LOCATION
then O
could O
play O
a O
leading O
and O
independent O
role O
for O
an O
international O
agreement O
to O
ban O
all O
nuclear O
strategy O
and O
weapons O
of O
mass O
destruction O
, O
and O
lay O
the O
basis O
for O
real O
peace O

progress O
. O

WHEN O
all O

He O
began O
his O

the O
lost O

they O
are O
also O
the O
technical O
means O
of O
abstraction O
. O

Every O
unnecessary O
detail O
, O
all O
superfluous O
local O
colouring O
must O
be O
eliminated O
. O

He O
does O
not O
want O
the O
accuracy O
of O
a O
police O

, O
but O
rather O
he O
wants O
to O
show O
the O
eternal O
in O
every O

. O

" O
The O

due O

much O
to O

to O
Wicki B-PERSON
the O
director O

His O
earlier O
film O
, O
" O

" O
was O
equally O

but O
here O
the O

moves O
out O
of O
the O
world O
of O
reality O
into O
an O
icy O
supernatural O
vacuum O
Following O
Bruce B-PERSON
Marshall's I-PERSON
original O
novel O
with O
considerable O
fidelity O
, O
the O
film O
tells O
the O
story O
of O
a O
little O
monk O
who O
prays O
that O
a O
disrepu- O
table O
night O
club O
near O
his O
church O
be O
re- O

One B-TIME
night I-TIME
his O
prayer O

the O
offending O
establishment O

suddenly O
transplanted O

in O
the O
North B-LOCATION

But O
Father O

up O

as O

. O

A O
summary O
of O
the O
story O
can O
give O
almost O
indication O
of O
the O
scope O
of O
Wicki's B-PERSON
artistry O
. O

He O
tells O
his O
story O
best O
in O
the O
faces O
of O
his O
crowds O
, O
recording O
every O
wrinkle O
and O
drop O
of O
sweat O
with O
brutal O
honesty O
, O
building O
up O
to O
a O
tremendous O
climax O
in O
the O
island O
orgy O

Here O
, O

arrive O
in O
ghost-like O
yachts O
, O

wildly O
flapping O
white O
sails O
slashed O
by O
the O
glaring O
beacon O
of O
a O
lighthouse O
. O

When O
the O
final O
miracle O
does O
occur O
, O
it O
is O
accepted O
as O
a O
marvellous O
joke O
; O
no O
one O
has O
learned O
anything O
. O

Wicki B-PERSON
suddenly O
returns O
to O
the O
city O
for O
a O
final O
epilogue O
. O

In O
complete O
silence O
he O
shows O
the O
faces O
of O
people O
walking O
in O
the O
streets O
, O
smug O
, O
content O
, O
satisfied O
, O
and O
thoroughly O
frightening O
. O

Wicki B-PERSON
has O
succeeded O
in O
his O
second B-CARDINAL
film O
in O
recording O
his O
personal O
apocalypse O
of O
the O
last B-TIME
days I-TIME
of O
a O
sick O
society O
. O

It O
is O
most O
unfair O
to O
call O
" O

" O
a O

NEXT B-TIME
month I-TIME
that O
friendly O
, O
effervescent O
performer O
Frankie B-PERSON
Vaughan I-PERSON
will O
burst O
on O
to O
the O
London B-LOCATION
Palladium I-LOCATION
stage O
in O
a O
new O
show O
. O

To O
paraphrase O
his O
well-known O
ditty O
: O
" O
He O
'll O
have O
the O
limelight O
, O
they O
'll O
give O
him O
the O
girls O
- O
and O
leave O
the O
rest O
to O
him O
. O

" O
I O
have O
a O
hunch O
that O
he O
will O
feel O
more O
at O
home O
in O
the O
old O
, O
star-studded O
West B-ORGANIZATION
End I-ORGANIZATION
than O
he O
will O
ever O
feel O
in O
Hollywood B-ORGANIZATION
. O

His O
American B-NORP
bosses O
, O
20th-Century B-ORGANIZATION
Fox I-ORGANIZATION
, O
have O
recently O
given O
Frankie B-PERSON
the O
full O
, O
razzamataz O
, O
red-carpet O
treatment O
. O

But O
they O
haven't O
done O
a O
thing O
for O
his O
film O
career O
that O
Anna B-PERSON
Neagle I-PERSON
and O
Herbert B-PERSON
Wilcox I-PERSON
were O
not O
doing O
better O
here O
, O
before O
the O
platinum-plated O
Hollywood B-ORGANIZATION
carrot O
was O
dangled O
before O
his O
nose O
. O

In O
his O
first B-CARDINAL
Hollywood B-ORGANIZATION
picture O
, O
" O
Let O
's O
Make O
Love O
, O
" O
he O
was O
swamped O
by O
the O
know-how O
of O
Marilyn B-PERSON
Monroe I-PERSON
and O
Yves B-PERSON
Montand I-PERSON
. O

Against O
this O
couple O
Frankie B-PERSON
, O
in O
a O
cardboard O
role O
, O
didn't O
stand O
a O
chance O
. O

Now O
comes O
" O
The O
Right O
Approach O
" O
( O
Rialto B-LOCATION
, O
" O
A O
" O
) O
, O
and O
it O
's O
a O
glum O
business O
. O

He O
plays O
an O
aspiring O
actor O
- O
a O
selfish O
, O
arrogant O
, O
brash O
, O
ambitious O
, O
unscrupulous O
heel O
- O
who O
would O
tread O
on O
anybody's O
neck O
to O
get O
a O
break O
in O
the O
Hollywood B-ORGANIZATION
ratrace O
. O

He O
double-crosses O
the O
five B-CARDINAL
pals O
with O
whom O
he O
lives O
, O
cheats O
a O
waitress O
( O
Juliet B-PERSON
Prowse I-PERSON
) O
and O
cynically O
uses O
a O
magazine O
editress O
( O
Martha B-PERSON
Hyer I-PERSON
) O
to O
get O
ahead O
. O

Frankie B-PERSON
Vaughan I-PERSON
is O
too O
nice O
a O
chap O
to O
ring O
quite O
true O
as O
a O
smooth-tongued O
, O
ill-mannered O
Yank B-NORP
. O

His O
best O
moments O
are O
when O
he O
swings O
breezily O
into O
the O
title O
song O
. O

But O
6,000 B-CARDINAL
miles O
seems O
a O
heck O
of O
a O
way O
to O
go O
for O
a O
new O
hit O
song O
. O

He O
might O
be O
well O
advised O
to O
think O
hard O
and O
long O
before O
his O
next O
jump O
into O
the O
Hollywood B-ORGANIZATION
arena O
. O

VERDICT O
: O
Vaughan B-PERSON
should O
have O
by-passed O
this O
approach O
. O

RONALD B-PERSON
Lewis I-PERSON
has O
just O
left O
for O
his O
first B-CARDINAL
taste O
of O
the O
Hollywood B-ORGANIZATION
treatment O
, O
thanks O
to O
a O
sound O
performance O
in O
" O
Taste O
of O
Fear O
" O
( O
Warner B-LOCATION
Theatre I-LOCATION
, O
" O
X O
" O
) O
. O

He O
has O
earned O
his O
break O
. O

The O
film O
is O
a O
well-made O
variation O
on O
that O
sinister O
yarn O
in O
which O
half B-CARDINAL
the O
cast O
try O
to O
persuade O
the O
heroine O
that O
she O
is O
out O
of O
her O
mind O
. O

Despite O
flagrant O
cheating O
the O
eerie O
atmosphere O
is O
built O
up O
neatly O
. O

Susan B-PERSON
Strasberg I-PERSON
is O
the O
crippled O
damsel O
in O
distress O
. O

Stepmother O
Ann B-PERSON
Todd I-PERSON
and O
doctor O
Christopher B-PERSON
Lee I-PERSON
are O
also O
effectively O
around O
. O

They O
provide O
some O
chilly O
red O
herrings O
in O
this O
" O
Find-the-body O
" O
thriller O
. O

VERDICT O
: O
Don't O
believe O
all O
you O
see O
and O
hear O
! O

NOT O
for O
the O
first B-CARDINAL
time O
the O
homely O
mug O
of O
Sidney B-PERSON
James I-PERSON
has O
pumped O
life O
into O
a O
slim O
, O
strained O
comedy O
. O

He O
does O
his O
rescue O
act O
in O
" O
Double O
Bunk O
" O
( O
Leicester-square B-LOCATION
Theatre I-LOCATION
, O

. O

Navigator O

a O
tower O
of O
strength O
when O

Janette B-PERSON
Scott I-PERSON
let O
loose O
their O
ancient O
houseboat O
on O
a O
honeymoon O
trip O
down O
the O
river O
. O

The O
film O
starts O
off O
brightly O
enough O
but O
, O
half-way O
through O
, O
the O
plot O
( O
as O
well O
as O
the O
boat O
) O
springs O
a O
near-disastrous O
leak O
. O

Familiar O
members O
of O

repertory O
team O
of O
comedy O
character-actors O
jump O
through O
equally O
familiar O
hoops O
to O
mild O
laughter O
. O

VERDICT O
: O
The O

needed O

DONALD B-PERSON
HOUSTON I-PERSON
had O
a O
big O
success O
on O
A T V's B-ORGANIZATION
" O
Drama O
'61 B-CARDINAL
" O
last B-TIME
night I-TIME
as O
a O
smooth O
, O
scheming O
jewel O
thief O
in O
a O
play O
by O
Jacques B-PERSON
Gillies I-PERSON
, O
" O
The O
Takers O
. O

" O
A O
polished O
production O
by O
Quentin B-PERSON
Lawrence I-PERSON
, O
here O
, O
held O
together O
by O
Mr. O
Houston's B-PERSON
accomplished O
performance O
as O
the O
master O
mind O
behind O
a O
gang O
of O
crooks O
. O

This O
plot O
to O
rob O
a O
French B-NORP
millionaire O
of O
300,000 B-CARDINAL
worth O
of O
jewellery O
struck O
me O
as O
ingenious O
. O

The O
play O
had O
style O
, O
moved O
at O
a O
quick O
pace O
and O
everyone O
did O
well O
. O

But O
it O
was O
Mr. O
Houston's B-PERSON
evening B-TIME
. O

Earlier O
, O
on O
the O
Palladium B-LOCATION
show O
I O
found O
Stanley B-PERSON
Holloway's I-PERSON
act O
too O
long O
and O
not O
particularly O
entertaining O
. O

It O
was O
also O
a O
mistake O
to O
re-book O
Gene B-PERSON
Detroy I-PERSON
and O
his O
performing O
chimpanzees O
so O
soon O
after O
their O
previous O
appearance O
. O

Their O
offering O
last B-TIME
night I-TIME
differed O
little O
from O
their O
earlier O
act O
on O
this O
show O
a B-TIME
week I-TIME
or I-TIME
so I-TIME
ago I-TIME
. O

But O
the O
Mudlarks O
, O
with O
Jeff B-PERSON
Mudd I-PERSON
out O
of O
the O
Army B-ORGANIZATION
and O
back O
with O
sister O
Mary B-PERSON
and O
brother O
Fred B-PERSON
, O
were O
in O
bright O
, O
zestful O
form O
. O

Why O
only O
two B-CARDINAL
numbers O
, O
though O
? O

It O
was O
not O
enough O
. O

" O
A O
FAIR O
COP O
, O
" O
the O
B B C B-ORGANIZATION
Whitehall B-LOCATION
farce O
last B-TIME
night I-TIME
, O
looked O
like O
a O
rabbit O
warren O
in O
a O
field O
of O
corn O
. O

I O
can't O
recall O
a O
production O
where O
so O
many O
comics O
bolted O
in O
and O
out O
of O
holes O
so O
often O
. O

The O
jokes O
were O
a O
reshuffle O
of O
the O
same O
old O
lot O
- O
this O
time O
Brian B-PERSON
Rix I-PERSON
lost O
his O
skirt O
instead O
of O
his O
trousers O
. O

The O
action O
moved O
at O
tremendous O
speed O
, O
backed O
by O
some O
wonderful O
timing O
by O
the O
cast O
. O

I O
especially O
liked O
the O
tea-cup O
scene O
where O
six B-CARDINAL
of O
the O
cast O
changed O
cups O
with O
the O
dexterity O
of O
Chinese B-NORP
jugglers O
. O

Carole B-PERSON
Shelley I-PERSON
as O
the O
newly-wed O
and O
Larry B-PERSON
Noble I-PERSON
as O
Smiler B-PERSON
Perkins I-PERSON
were O
the O
most O
laughable O
. O

They O
alone O
used O
a O
sharp O
edge O
to O
their O
humour O
and O
cut O
through O
the O
gormless O
standing O
corn O
around O
them O
. O

Perhaps O
it O
was O
accidental O
- O
I O
hope O
not O
. O

If O
ever O
a O
bag O
of O
humour O
needed O
a O
thorough O
shaking O
up O
the O
Whitehall B-LOCATION
farce O
is O
it O
when O
it O
comes O
to O
television O
. O

HOW O
do O
you O
get O
on O
records O
? O

Well O
, O
you O
've O
got O
to O
have O
something O
different O
. O

Sing O
slightly O
flat O
. O

All O
the O
good O
singers O
sing O
in O
tune O
. O

Twang O
a O
guitar O
slightly O
off O
key O
. O

Everybody O
's O
fed O
up O
with O
the O
right O
way O
- O
so O
the O
best-seller O
charts O
say O
. O

Play O
an O
OLD O
2pianna O
instead O
of O
a O
new O
one O
. O

You O
got O
to O
get O
it O
into O
your O
head O
, O
son O
... O
people O
don't O
like O
things O
as O
they O
should O
be O

not O

anyway O
. O

Thus O
, O
musician O
David B-PERSON

were O
greatly O

" O
He O
did O
, O
on O

at O
home O
. O

There O
weren't O
enough O
tacks O
and O
he O
got O
only O

Then O
he O
tried O

DELIGHTFUL O

put O
the O

I O

It O

a O

Deirdre's B-PERSON

" O
It O
is O

authentic O
as O

But O
will O
we O

its O
end O

The O
last O
scene O
of O
this O

is O
in O
a O

where O
the O

throws O
a O
10 B-CARDINAL
note O
on O

orders O
a O

It O
gives O
one B-CARDINAL
loud O

clear O

falls O
flat O
on O
its O

This O
brilliant O

I O
may O
add O

gets O
no O

but O
I O
don't O
think O
it O
was O
through O
boredom O

The O
film O
is O
funny O
enough O
in O
places O
and O
has O
a O
line O
or O
two B-CARDINAL
of O
painful O
home O
truths O
thrown O
in O
. O

" O
I O
don't O

The O
plain O

sober O
manner O
of O
its O

all O
the O
more O

points O
up O
not O

the O

which O
floundered O
on O

of O
a O
German- B-NORP

to O
the O
raree-show O

Lucky O

these O
are O
proud O
possessions O

linked O
to O
the O
exquisite O
lace-making O
of O
the O
past O
. O

But O
lace-making O
is O
by O
no O
means O
a O
lost O
art O
. O

It O
suffered O
a O
decline O
and O
fell O
into O
lamentably O
low O
standards O
in O
the O
fussy O
over-furnishing O
of O
the O
Victorian B-TIME

but O
it O
would O
take O
more O
than O
a O
temporary O
lapse O
in O
good O
taste O
to O
destroy O
this O
lovely O

craft O

It O
has O
, O
in O

readily O
adapted O
itself O
to O
modern O
tastes O

how O

Although O
we O
assess O
lace-making O
as O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
the O
feminine O
skills O
, O
a O
number O
of O
the O
well-loved O
traditional O
patterns O
that O
we O
follow O
today B-TIME
were O
, O
in O
fact O
, O
the O
brain-children O
of O
inventive O
men O
. O

For O
in O
the O
old O
order O
of O
things O
, O
men O
designed O
and O
worked O
lace O
as O
well O
as O
women O
and O
special O
schools O
were O
set O
up O
to O
teach O
lace- O
making O
not O
only O
to O
young O
girls O
, O
but O
to O
little O
boys O
as O
well O
. O

Whole O
families O
made O
their O
livelihood O
by O
lace-making O
and O
consequently O
a O
folklore O
of O
song O
, O
festival O
and O
courtship O
grew O
up O
around O
the O
lace O
industry O
. O

During O
the B-TIME
sixteenth I-TIME
century I-TIME
a O
considerable O
amount O
of O
crochet O
was O
produced O
in O
the O
convents O
of O
Europe B-LOCATION
. O

Without O
doubt O
it O
was O
the O
nuns O
who O
carried O
the O
craft O
to O
Ireland B-LOCATION
. O

There O
it O
was O
developed O
into O
quite O
an O
elaborate O
and O
distinctive O
form O
with O
rosettes O
, O
leaves O
and O
lace O
fillings O
. O

During O
the O
time O
of O
Victoria B-PERSON
this O
gentle O
craft O
was O
greatly O
abused O
. O

In O
some O
of O
the O
elegant O
boutiques O
of O
Paris B-LOCATION
hand-crocheted O
blouses O
, O
gossamer O
fine O
in O
texture O
, O
are O
sold O
at O
a O
very O
high O
price O
. O

With O
a O
little O
time O
and O
concentration O
the O
woman O
at O
home O
can O
produce O
fashion O
articles O
as O
elegant O
as O
those O
of O
Paris B-LOCATION
- O
a O
blouse O
, O
delicate O
gloves O
or O
a O
fine O
edging O
for O
collar O
, O
cuffs O
or O
a O
handkerchief O
. O

In O
the O
home O
, O
crochet O
lace O
can O
be O
used O
to O
make O
tablecloths O
, O
traycloths O
and O
runners O
, O
and O
edgings O
from O
heavy O
to O
fine O
can O
fulfil O
a O
variety O
of O
functions O
. O

The O
art O
of O
crochet O
is O
not O
difficult O
and O
it O
is O
reasonably O
quick O
to O
work O
. O

In O
the O
following O
pages O
simple O
diagrams O
and O
instructions O
are O

A O
household O

, O
Coats B-ORGANIZATION
Mercer-Crochet O
possesses O
qualities O
which O
are O
of O
the O
utmost O
importance O
to O
the O
worker O
. O

It O
washes O
beautifully O
, O
never O
loses O
its O
colour O
nor O
becomes O
' O

, O
is O
very O
elastic O

work O
with O
, O
soft O
, O
glossy O
and O
of O
uniform O
thickness O
- O
it O

Remember O
that O

plays O
an O
important O
part O

A O
great O
deal O
of O
modern O
furniture O
has O
tapered O
legs O
, O
and O
in O
reproduction O
period O
pieces O
they O
are O
frequently O
used O
. O

The O
simpler O
varieties O
are O
extremely O
easy O
to O
work O
, O
the O
four B-CARDINAL
sides O
being O
simply O
planed O
to O
give O
the O
required O
taper O
. O

In O
the O
more O
elaborate O
varieties O
, O
however O
, O
a O
toe O
is O
worked O
in O
the O
solid O
, O
and O
this O
certainly O
complicates O
the O
operation O
. O

For O
short O
ones O
a O
smoothing O
plane O
can O
be O
used O
. O

The O
gauge O
can O
now O
be O
used O
to O
nick O
in O
the O
tapers O
on O
the O
newly O
planed O
surfaces O
, O
and O
these O
treated O
as O
before O
. O

It O
is O
unnecessary O
to O
mark O
the O
taper O
with O
the O
straight-edge O
as O
one O
relies O
upon O
the O
truth O
of O
the O
plane O
sole O
to O
make O
the O
tapered O
surfaces O
straight O
. O

A O
glance O
at O
the O
gauge O
marks O
at O
the O
bottom O
end O
reveals O
when O
the O
required O
amount O
has O
been O
removed O
, O
and O
if O
care O
is O
taken O
to O
stop O
the O
plane O
short O
of O
the O
squared O
pencil O
line O
at O
the O
top O
, O
the O
work O
will O
be O
accurate O
. O

The O
straight-edge O
can O
be O
used O
to O
test O
the O
straightness O
of O
the O
sides O
. O

Incidentally O
, O
it O
is O
better O
to O
complete O
any O
mortising O
that O
may O
be O
needed O
at O
the O
top O
before O
the O
tapering O
is O
begun O
. O

Some O
plain O
tapered O
legs O
have O
the O
taper O
on O
the O
two B-CARDINAL
inner O
faces O
only O
, O
the O
outer O
surfaces O
being O
vertical O
as O
at O
( O

To O
make O
a O
leg O
such O
as O
that O

Note O
that O
squared O
lines O
marking O
the O
top O
member O
of O
the O
toe O
are O
needed O
as O
well O
as O
the O
upper O
ex- O
tent O
of O
the O
taper O
, O
and O
in O
this O
case O
it O
is O
necessary O
to O
mark O
in O
the O
line O
of O
the O
taper O
with O
pencil O
and O
straight-edge O
as O
at O
( O

A O
saw O
cut O
is O
made O
at O
the O
upper O

line O
exactly O
down O
to O
the O
taper O
line O
, O
no O
farther O
. O

But O
why O
woodwork O
in O
particular O
? O

Well O
, O
there O
are O
many O
reasons O
. O

Wood O
is O
in O
good O
and O
common O
supply O
; O
it O
lends O
itself O
to O
making O
innumerable O
useful O
household O
items O
- O
furniture O
, O
fitments O
, O
garden O
items O
, O
toys O
, O
etc. O
; O
it O
enables O
results O
to O
be O
obtained O
fairly O
quickly O
; O
it O
is O
less O
expensive O
than O
most O
other O
materials O
; O
it O
is O
a O
pleasant O
material O
to O
work O
with O
; O
and O
, O
although O
it O
does O
create O
a O
certain O
amount O
of O
mess O
, O
it O
is O
all O
clean O
and O
easily O
cleared O
away O
. O

This O
last O
point O
is O
certainly O
important O
because O
almost O
everyone O
has O
come O
to O
recognise O
that O
machines O
are O
not O
only O
an O
economic O
necessity O
, O
but O
that O
a O
great O
deal O
of O
drudgery O
can O
be O
avoided O
by O
the O
installation O
of O
a O
power O
tool O
. O

As O
an O
elementary O
example O
, O
surely O
no O
one O
can O
pretend O
to O
enjoy O
ripping O
out O
parts O
from O
hardwood O
. O

Most O
men O
would O
unhesitatingly O
use O
a O
machine O
if O
it O
were O
available O
. O

Coming O
now O
to O
the O
actual O
tools O
and O
their O
cost O
, O
we O
begin O
with O
what O
we O
have O
called O
a O
bare O
minimum O
kit O
. O

Probably O
most O
men O
have O
some O
of O
the O
tools O
already O
. O

It O
will O
enable O
a O
man O
to O
make O
simple O
, O
straight-forward O
things O
, O
and O
in O
any O
case O
may O
be O
regarded O
as O
a O
good O
beginning O
to O
which O
other O
tools O
can O
be O
added O
as O
the O
need O
arises O
. O

The O
nature O
of O
the O
work O
will O
probably O
dictate O
the O
additions O
to O
be O
made O
, O
but O
as O
a O
guide O
we O
have O
given O
a O
fuller O
kit O
which O
increases O
the O
range O
of O
things O
that O
can O
be O
made O
enormously O
. O

As O
a O
still O
further O
development O
, O
we O
follow O
with O
a O
good O
basic O
kit O
, O
which O
includes O
the O
fuller O
kit O
( O
which O
in O
its O
turn O
, O
of O
course O
, O
includes O
the O
bare O
minimum O
kit O
) O
. O

With O
this O
the O
vast O
majority O
of O
jobs O
can O
be O
done O
, O
though O
for O
advanced O
cabinet O
work O
the O
necessity O
for O
certain O
special O
tools O
will O
become O
obvious O
. O

Lastly O
, O
we O
suggest O
certain O
power O
tools O
and O
machines O
, O
the O
choice O
of O
which O
will O
depend O
partly O
upon O
the O
space O
available O
in O
the O
workshop O
, O
the O
amount O
one O
is O
prepared O
to O
pay O
, O
and O
the O
type O
of O
work O
a O
man O
normally O
does O
. O

First B-CARDINAL
, O
however O
, O
a O
word O
of O
advice O
generally O
. O

Do O
not O
buy O
so-called O
cheap O
tools O
or O
machines O
. O

They O
never O
are O
cheap O
in O
the O
long O
run O
. O

They O
may O
be O
inaccurate O
, O
Most O
tools O
have O
to O
lead O
an O
intensive O
life O
, O
and O
faults O
in O
design O
or O
quality O
soon O
become O
apparent O
. O

It O
is O
far O
better O
to O
pay O
the O
fair O
price O
for O
a O
tool O
of O
good O
quality O
, O
and O
not O
handicap O
yourself O
from O
the O
start O
. O

To O
put O
it O
in O
a O
slightly O
different O
way O
, O
do O
not O
allow O
yourself O
to O
blame O
the O
tools O
when O
the O
job O
does O
not O
turn O
out O
quite O
right O
! O

Many O
men O
with O
only O
limited O
accommodation O
have O
to O
do O
their O
woodwork O
on O
the O
kitchen O
table O
. O

Providing O
this O
is O
sound O
, O
some O
perfectly O
good O
work O
can O
be O
done O
on O
it O
, O
but O
the O
usual O
problems O
are O
those O
of O
the O
vice O
, O
the O
bench O
stop O
, O
and O
storage O
place O
for O
tools O
. O

The O
combined O
bench O
top O
and O
tool O
cupboard O
shown O
here O
has O
been O
specially O
designed O
and O
made O
for O
WOODWORKER B-ORGANIZATION
readers O
who O
have O
this O
difficulty O
. O

HERE O
is O
a O
project O
that O
will O
be O
welcomed O
by O
the O
family O
man O
or O
father-to-be O
. O

Unlike O
many O
commercial O
articles O
, O
this O
chair O
is O
solidly O
built O
and O
capable O
of O
withstanding O
the O
heavy O
handling O
of O
the O
most O
destructive O
youngster O
. O

Almost O
any O
available O
timber O
can O
be O
used O
but O
Parana B-LOCATION
pine O
is O
recommended O
, O
being O
cheap O
, O
easy O
to O
work O
, O
and O
taking O
a O
good O
finish O
. O

Start O
by O
making O
the O
two B-CARDINAL
side O
frames O
from O
1 B-CARDINAL

by O
1 B-CARDINAL
1/4 I-CARDINAL
in. O
planed O
timber O
as O
shown O
in O
Fig. O
1 B-CARDINAL
. O

Although O
the O
timber O
will O
have O
already O
been O
machine O
planed O
, O
remember O
to O
go O
over O
each O
piece O
with O
a O
smoothing O
plane O
, O
otherwise O
the O
marks O
left O
by O
the O
cutters O
will O
show O
up O
after O
painting O
. O

The O
dimensions O
given O
enable O
the O
feeding O
tray O
to O
slide O
over O
a O
30 B-CARDINAL
in. O
table O
, O
but O
the O
height O
can O
be O
altered O
if O
required O
. O

All O
the O
joints O
are O
simple O
halving O
joints O
glued O
and O
pinned O
, O
which O
should O
nevertheless O
be O
cut O
with O
care O
to O
ensure O
a O
neat O
appearance O
. O

The O
side O
frames O
are O
joined O
by O
four B-CARDINAL
cross O
pieces O

These O
are O
then O

and O
the O
width O
is O

taken O
directly O
from O
the O

to O
ensure O
a O
good O

. O

Fix O
the O
piece O
A O
to O
the O
sides O
first B-CARDINAL
with O
glue O
and O
panel O
pins O
and O
then O
fit O
the O
frame O
together O
with O
the O
piece O
B O
temporarily O
in O
place O
on O
the O
chair O

. O

Decide O
on O
the O
required O
angle O
of O
slope O
, O
keeping O
B O
flat O
on O
the O
chair O
seat O
, O
and O
mark O
off O
the O
exact O
position O
of O
B O
on O
the O
side O
pieces O
. O

These O
can O
then O
be O
cut O
at O
the O
correct O
angle O
and O
B O
is O
glued O
and O
nailed O
in O
place O
. O

A O
piece O
of O
hardboard O
is O
then O
cut O
and O
pinned O
to O
the O
frame O
and O
its O
edges O
planed O
off O

. O

Finally O
attach O
the O
back O
firmly O
to O
the O
sides O
with O
screws O
driven O
from O
the O
inside O
. O

The O
footrest O
is O
a O

the O
front O
legs O
with O
a O

as O
shown O
in O
Fig. O

. O

When O
determining O
the O
position O
of O
the O
footrest O
, O
do O
not O
place O
too O
near O
the O
seat O
to O
allow O
for O
the O
growth O
of O
baby's O
legs O
. O

To O
complete O
the O
job O
, O
screw O
two B-CARDINAL
fittings O
to O
the O
inside O
of O
the O
chair O
arms O
about B-CARDINAL
2 I-CARDINAL
1/2 I-CARDINAL
in. O
from O
the O
back O
to O
hold O
the O
baby's O
safety O
harness O
. O

These O
can O
be O
made O
by O
shaping O
and O
soldering O
two B-CARDINAL
pieces O
of O
stout O
wire O
as O
shown O
in O
Fig. O
6 B-CARDINAL
. O

Make O
sure O
that O
these O
are O
well O
secured O
as O
they O
will O
have O
to O
withstand O
considerable O
pulling O
as O
the O
child O
becomes O
older O
. O

Punch O
in O
all O
nail O
and O
panel O
pin O
heads O
and O
fill O
the O
holes O
with O
plastic O
wood O
. O

Then O
thoroughly O
glasspaper O
the O
whole O
framework O
and O
round O
off O
any O
sharp O
edges O
( O
such O
as O
the O
edge O
of O
the O
seat O
, O
feeding O
tray O
, O
etc O
) O
. O

Fill O
the O
grain O
with O
a O
woodfiller O
in O
the O
usual O
way O
and O
paint O
the O
frame O
in O
a O
suitable O
pastel O
shade O
, O
using O
a O
contrasting O
colour O
for O
the O
seat O
and O
the O
back O
which O
can O
be O
decorated O
with O
a O
suitable O
nursery O
transfer O
. O

Avoid O
using O
lead-based O
paint O
as O
this O
could O
prove O
poisonous O
if O
junior O
decides O
to O
bite O
the O
chair O
. O

Finally O
, O
it O
is O
as O
well O
to O
cover O
the O
footrest O
with O
rubber O
or O
any O
such O
protective O
material O
that O
might O
be O
available O
as O
otherwise O
the O

BUILDING O
your O
own O
boat O
is O
a O
most O
satisfying O
and O
worthwhile O
project O
. O

Here O
are O
the O
plans O
of O
a O
very O
seaworthy O
little O
rowing O
dinghy O
many O
of O
which O
I O
have O
built O
and O
sold O
. O

It O
is O
especially O
designed O
for O
simplicity O
in O
construction O
, O
cheapness O
and O
lightness O
of O
weight O
, O
and O
measures O
approximately B-CARDINAL
8 I-CARDINAL
ft. O
by O
4 B-CARDINAL
ft. O
She O
weighs O
only O
60 B-CARDINAL
lb. O
but O
can O
carry O
three B-CARDINAL
people O
and O
an O
outboard O
motor O
with O
a O
comfortable O
margin O
of O
freeboard O
. O

For O
instance O
, O
in O
Canada B-LOCATION
we O
use O
galvanised O
nails O
in O
place O
of O
screws O
. O

We O
just O
bend O
them O
over O
and O
clamp O
firmly O
by O
using O
a O
hammer O
on O
each O
side O
. O

Over O
here O
I O
've O
always O
used O
brass O
screws O
, O
which O
are O
more O
expensive O
. O

The O
first B-CARDINAL
job O
is O
to O
make O
your O
moulds O
. O

In O
Fig. O
1 B-CARDINAL
it O
quotes O
3/4 B-CARDINAL
in. O
five-ply B-CARDINAL
, O
but O
to O
save O
money O
any O
scrap O
may O
be O
used O
, O
and O
if O
this O
is O
nailed O
and O
glued O
together O
strongly O
, O
it O
may O
be O
marked O
and O
cut O
to O
shape O
later O
. O

If O
you O
do O
not O
have O
a O
wooden O
floor O
on O
which O
to O
anchor O
the O
moulds O
, O
make O
a O
frame O
of O
rough O
lumber O
as O
shown O
in O
Fig. O
2 B-CARDINAL
. O

The O
main O
idea O
is O
to O
have O
the O
moulds O
standing O
as O
rigid O
as O
possible O
, O
for O
it O
is O
on O
these O
you O
will O
be O
building O
and O
shaping O
your O
little O
craft O
, O
upside-down O
. O

For O
cheapness O
I O
recommend O
using O
Douglas O
Fir O
Plywood O
from O
British B-LOCATION
Columbia I-LOCATION
. O

This O
is O
hot O
pressed O
and O
resin O
bonded O
to O
ensure O
a O
permanently O
water O
proof O
glue O
line O
. O

Be O
sure O
to O
see O
that O
the O
edge O
bears O
the O
mark O
, O
P.M.B.C. O
Exterior O
. O

This O
may O
be O
bought O
at O
any O
good O
timber O
merchants O
. O

The O
transoms O
can O
be O
made O
of O
any O
sound O
five-ply B-CARDINAL
wood O
of O
the O
same O
make O
, O
or O
oak O
or O
mahogany O
. O

For O
the O
last O
one O
I O
made O
, O
I O
used O
the O
two B-CARDINAL
flaps O
from O
an O
old O
mahogany O
table O
which O
I O
bought O
at O
a O
sale O
for O
one B-CARDINAL
shilling O
. O

I O
have O
also O
included O
a O
sketch O
of O
paddles O
I O
make O
for O
rowing O
this O
dinghy O
( O
Fig. O
3 B-CARDINAL
) O
. O

They O
are O
very O
simple O
, O
cheap O
and O
easy O
to O
make O
. O

As O
will O
be O
seen O
from O
the O
plan O
there O
is O
only O
a O
single O
gunwale O
on O
the O
outside O
. O

I O
find O
that O
the O
type O
of O
rowlock O
we O
use O
in O
Canada B-LOCATION
is O
difficult O
to O
obtain O
here O
and O
expensive O
. O

I O
overcome O
this O
in O
another O
way O
as O
shown O
in O
Fig. O
4 B-CARDINAL
. O

Cut O
the O
moulds O
and O
the O
transoms O
to O
shape O
as O
in O
the O
detailed O
drawings O
. O

If O
you O
have O
a O
wooden O
floor O
you O
can O
use O
' O
A O
' O
frames O
fastened O
to O
the O
floor O
if O
not O
, O
use O
a O
strong O
horizontal O
frame O
that O
will O
sit O
firmly O
on O
the O
ground O
or O
concrete O
floor O
. O

I O
use O
a O
heavy O
old O
base O
as O
in O
Fig. O
2 B-CARDINAL
. O

The O
edges O
of O
the O
transoms O
should O
be O
bevelled O
to O
correspond O
to O
the O
sides O
and O
bottom O
of O
the O
boat O
. O

Don't O
forget O
to O
cut O
out O
on O
each O
side O
of O
each O
mould O
to O
allow O
for O
the O
chines O
to O
rest O
in O
these O
notches O
, O
as O
they O
are O
not O
fastened O
to O
the O
moulds O
, O
which O
will O
only O
be O
used O
whilst O
the O
hull O
is O
under O
construction O
. O

The O
chine O
is O
the O
long O
stringer O
on O
each O
side O
which O
is O
joined O
to O
both O
transoms O
and O
lies O
in O
the O
grooves O
cut O
in O
the O
moulds O
. O

Each O
chine O
is O
made O
of O
oak O
, O
ash O
, O
spruce O
or O
any O
long O
grained O
flexible O
wood O
. O

I O
prefer O
spruce O
when O
available O
. O

As O
will O
be O
seen O
in O
the O
plan O
, O
the O
transoms O
have O
a O
frame O
1 B-CARDINAL
in. O
by O
1 B-CARDINAL
in. O
on O
each O
side O
. O

The O
chines O
are O
morticed O
into O
this O
and O
butt O
up O
against O
the O
transom O
. O

Start O
at O
the O
bow O
and O
spring O
them O
both O
at O
the O
same O
time O
over O
the O
slots O
cut O
in O
the O
moulds O
and O
into O
the O
notches O
cut O
for O
this O
purpose O
in O
the O
stern O
or O
after O
transom O
framing O
. O

Glue O
, O
screw O
and O
make O
fast O
. O

The O
skeleton O
of O
the O
boat O
will O
now O
take O
shape O
, O
and O
this O
is O
the O
time O
to O
check O
before O
making O
fast O
to O
see O
that O
nothing O
is O
distorted O
. O

Ensure O
that O
the O
outside O
measurements O
from O
transom O
to O
transom O
are O
equal O
on O
each O
side O
and O
that O
the O
transoms O
are O
parallel O
horizontally O
. O

Next O
bevel O
the O
chines O
with O
a O
plane O
so O
that O
the O
bottom O
will O
fit O
snugly O
. O

Cut O
out O
the O
bottom O
and O
sides O
accurately O
from O
the O
plan O
measurements O
but O
leave O
sufficient O
margin O
for O
planing O
after O
fixing O
to O
the O
boat O
. O

Use O
your O
two B-CARDINAL
lengths O
of O
8 B-CARDINAL
ft. O
by O
4 B-CARDINAL
ft. O
ply O
for O
this O
purpose O
, O
the O
sides O
from O
one O
, O
and O
the O
bottom O
from O
the O
other O
. O

If O
care O
is O
taken O
not O
to O
waste O
the O
ply O
, O
plenty O
of O
material O
is O
left O
over O
for O
the O
thwarts O
. O

Having O
trimmed O
up O
the O
chines O
, O
we O
are O
now O
ready O
to O
plank O
the O
sides O
. O

Start O
again O
at O
the O
bows O
, O
clamping O
into O
position O
with O
a O
' O
D O
' O
clamp O
. O

Bend O
round O
the O
frame O
to O
the O
stern O
and O
clamp O
there O
. O

If O
you O
have O
a O
third B-CARDINAL
clamp O
use O
it O
in O
the O
centre O
as O
well O
. O

After O
generously O
covering O
with O
glue O
, O
screw O
the O
sides O
to O
the O
transom O
framing O
and O
the O
chine O
. O

Use O
5/8 B-CARDINAL
by O
No. O
4 B-CARDINAL
gauge O
screws O
( O
brass O
) O
or O
nail O
with O
inch O
and O
a O
quarter O
galvanized O
nails O
, O
if O
you O
are O
doing O
it O
that O
way O
. O

Use O
flat O
head O
screws O
about B-CARDINAL
4 I-CARDINAL
in. O
apart O
and O
do O
not O
counter-sink O
in O
the O
1/4 B-CARDINAL
in. O
ply O
. O

Make O
a O
very O
small O
hole O
for O
the O
screw O
to O
allow O
for O
a O
good O
grip O
. O

Remember O
to O
glue O
before O
screwing O
. O

Clean O
up O
with O
the O
plane O
ready O
for O
the O
bottom O
, O
which O
is O
cut O
in O
one B-CARDINAL
piece O
. O

It O
should O
overlap O
just O
a O
trifle O
; O
this O
can O
be O
cleaned O
up O
later O
. O

As O
you O
are O
screwing O
and O
gluing O
this O
piece O
to O
the O
chines O
it O
is O
necessary O
to O
be O
careful O
not O
to O
miss O
the O
chine O
with O
the O
screws O
. O

I O
prefer O
spacing O
screws O
3 B-CARDINAL
in. O
apart O
for O
the O
bottom O
, O
both O
for O
screwing O
to O
the O
chines O
and O
the O
bottom O
shaped O
transom O
facing O
. O

Again O
, O
don't O
forget O
to O
glue O
. O

Now O
put O
on O
the O
keel O
and O
the O
rubbing O
strakes O
and O
you O
are O
ready O
to O
lift O
the O
boat O
off O
the O
moulds O
. O

You O
won't O
want O
them O
again O
for O
this O
boat O
, O
so O
shift O
them O
right O
out O
of O
the O
way O
. O

Place O
the O
boat O
right O
side O
up O
on O
two B-CARDINAL
boxes O
or O
trestles O
of O
convenient O
height O
for O
working O
. O

Fix O
on O
the O
gunwales O
and O
insert O
the O
thwarts O
( O
seats O
) O
taking O
care O
to O
reinforce O
the O
sides O
of O
the O
dinghy O
at O
the O
seats O
with O
vertical O
members O
as O
shown O
in O
the O
plans O
. O

Make O
the O
four B-CARDINAL
blocks O
for O
the O
rowlocks O
and O
mark O
their O
positions O
before O
riveting O
on O
the O
gunwales O
so O
that O
you O
do O
not O
put O
a O
rivet O
where O
you O
will O
have O
to O
cut O
out O
the O
inside O
( O
gunwale O
) O
one O
to O
fit O
the O
block O
. O

I O
rivet O
my O
gunwales O
together O
through O
the O
side O
of O
the O
hull O
with O
copper O
nails O
and O
roves O
. O

It O
greatly O
improves O
the O
appearance O
and O
the O
strength O
. O

Paint O
with O
good O
marine O
primer O
, O
undercoat O
and O
at B-CARDINAL
least I-CARDINAL
one I-CARDINAL
coat O
of O

According O

, O
the O

trecking O

. O

Meanwhile O
Mr. O
Moncrieff B-PERSON
had O
sent O
me O
an O
egg-case O
of O
the O
Chinese B-NORP
mantis O
. O

The O
first B-CARDINAL
mantis O
had O
hatched O
from O
the O
very O
large O
egg-case O
on O
June B-TIME

Both O
the O
Chinese B-NORP

Spanish B-NORP

, O
in O
the O

any O

are O
light O

Because O
of O
the O
cool O
, O
wet O

, O
I O
had O
great O
difficulty O
in O
breeding O
fruit O
flies O
and O
, O
after O
many O

the O

Of O

only O
two B-CARDINAL

the O

; O
one B-CARDINAL
thrived O
and O
the O
latest O
report O
I O
have O
is O
that O
this O

is O
still O
alive O
. O

DESPITE O
the O
steady O
influx O
of O
substitutes O
since O
the O
end O
of O
the O
war O
, O
clay O
pots O
are O
still O
in O
greatest O
demand O
. O

It O
is O
mostly O
in O
the O
smaller O
sizes O
that O
the O
substitutes O
have O
made O
headway O
, O
and O
although O
numerous O
small O
clay O
pots O
are O
used O
each B-TIME
year I-TIME
, O
they O
are O
fewer O
than O
they O
were O
10 B-TIME
years I-TIME
ago I-TIME
. O

In O
the O
larger O
sizes O
there O
is O
still O
no O
real O
substitute O
for O
clay O
that O
can O
be O
obtained O
at O
a O
comparable O
price O
, O
except O
the O
bituminized O
paper O
pots O
which O
are O
used O
on O
commercial O
nurseries O
for O
growing O
tomatoes O
The O
main O
disadvantage O
of O
the O
clay O
pot O
is O
its O
brittle O
nature O
; O
even O
with O
reasonably O
careful O
handling O
, O
the O
annual O
losses O
are O
often O
around B-CARDINAL
10 I-CARDINAL
per O
cent. O
, O
and O
where O
the O
handling O
and O
storage O
facilities O
are O
not O
too O
good O
, O
these O
losses O
will O
be O
even O
greater O
. O

This O
does O
not O
necessarily O
apply O
to O
the O
larger O
sizes O
, O
as O
they O
are O
not O
quite O
so O
fragile O
as O
the O
smaller O
ones O
and O
are O
not O
normally O
thrown O
about O
in O
quite O
the O
same O
way O
. O

The O
storage O
problem O
puts O
clay O
pots O
at O
a O
definite O
disadvantage O
. O

They O
are O
fairly O
heavy O
and O
difficult O
things O
to O
accommodate O
and O
they O
must O
have O
some O
protection O
from O
severe O
weather O
, O
which O
can O
be O
quite O
a O
headache O
in O
a O
small O
garden O
. O

While O
admitting O
that O
broken O
pots O
have O
on O
occasions O
provided O
artists O
with O
delightful O
studies O
, O
there O
is O
no O
doubt O
that O
a O
pile O
of O
badly O
stacked O
, O
half-broken B-CARDINAL
pots O
is O
an O
unlovely O
sight O
from O
any O
point O
of O
view O
. O

Every O
garden O
boy O
will O
agree O
that O
having O
to O
wash O
clay O
pots O
is O
a O
definite O
factor O
in O
favour O
of O
their O
abolition O
; O
in O
fact O
one B-CARDINAL
young O
man O
was O
so O
wholehearted O
about O
this O
a B-TIME
few I-TIME
years I-TIME
ago I-TIME
that O
he O
made O
the O
headlines O
for O
having O
smashed O
a O
large O
number O
 O
to O
relieve O
his O
feelings O
. O

On O
the O
small-to-medium O
establishment O
, O
it O
is O
a O
disagreeable O
chore O
which O
nobody O
tackles O
with O
any O
enthusiasm O
, O
whereas O
on O
larger O
establishments O
the O
pots O
can O
be O
sterilized O
or O
washed O
by O
machine O
. O

It O
is O
not O
easy O
to O
make O
an O
economic O
comparison O
between O
clay O
pots O
and O
the O
various O
substitutes O
; O
the O
former O
may O
last O
indefinitely O
with O
luck O
, O
while O
the O
latter O
are O
often O
expendable O
used O
only O
once O
. O

Clay O
pots O
are O
efficient O
and O
congenial O
containers O
in O
which O
to O
grow O
plants O
. O

In O
their O
proper O
setting O
they O
are O
not O
unattractive O
and O
, O
in O
spite O
of O
their O
shortcomings O
, O
most O
gardeners O
have O
a O
nostalgic O
affection O
for O
them O
. O

Present-day O
pots O
are O
better O
finished O
, O
do O
not O
get O
dirty O
so O
readily O
and O
are O
easier O
to O
wash O
. O

The O
deep O
rims O
make O
for O
neater O
and O
safer O
stacking O
, O
though O
they O
are O
still O
expensive O
and O
still O
get O
broken O
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
there O
is O
really O
no O
replacement O
for O
the O
larger O
sizes O
, O
so O
they O
have O
the O
decided O
advantage O
of O
being O
the O
only O
suitable O
container O
available O
in O
quantity O
for O
fairly O
large O
plants O
. O

Soil O
blocks O
are O
probably O
the O
oldest O
alternative O
to O
clay O
pots O
for O
plant O
raising O
. O

These O
are O
compressed O
blocks O
of O
compost O
, O
made O
in O
a O
specially O
devised O
press O
to O
simulate O
roughly O
the O
shape O
and O
size O
of O
a O
pot O
. O

Usually O
cylindrical O
or O
hexagonal O
in O
shape O
, O
they O
are O
made O
of O
the O
same O
compost O
as O
would O
have O
been O
used O
in O
a O
pot O
, O
the O
 O
only O
difference O
being O
that O
it O
is O
used O
in O
a O
slightly O
moister O
condition O
. O

Seed O
is O
sown O
, O
or O
seedlings O
are O
pricked O
out O
into O
them O
in O
the O
normal O
way O
, O
the O
only O
real O
difference O
being O
that O
more O
of O
the O
watering O
is O
done O
through O
a O
rose O
to O
avoid O
breaking O
the O
blocks O
with O
a O
spout O
of O
water O
. O

First-class B-CARDINAL
plants O
of O
tomatoes O
, O
cucumbers O
, O
marrows O
, O
melons O
, O
cauliflowers O
, O
celery O
and O
onions O
, O
may O
all O
be O
raised O
in O
soil O
blocks O
; O
so O
can O
such O
flowering O
plants O
as O
dahlias O
, O
chrysanthemums O
, O
salvias O
, O
sweet O
peas O
, O
lupins O
and O
numerous O
others O
. O

One B-CARDINAL
big O
advantage O
of O
soil O
blocks O
is O
an O
obvious O
one O
: O
the O
cost O
of O
a O
pot O
of O
any O
description O
is O
saved O
completely O
. O

Manufacturing O
the O
block O
and O
planting O
it O
is O
very O
little O
more O
trouble O
than O
normal O
potting O
, O
and O
a O
superior O
plant O
, O
which O
transplants O
more O
easily O
, O
is O
produced O
. O

The O
obvious O
limitation O
 O
is O
that O
soil O
blocks O
can O
only O
be O
used O
for O
propagating O
; O
there O
can O
be O
no O
progression O
to O
a O
larger O
block O
when O
the O
plant O
or O
seedling O
is O
ready O
to O
be O
moved O
; O
it O
must O
be O
planted O
out O
or O
potted O
. O

Many O
amateur O
gardeners O
might O
improve O
their O
results O
by O
buying O
a O
small O
hand-operated O
soil O
block O
maker O
and O
use O
the O
money O
saved O
on O
buying O
small O
pots O
to O
improve O
their O
composts O
. O

The O
various O
types O
of O
small O
paper O
pots O
are O
very O
useful O
for O
short-term O
operations O
, O
but O
are O
inclined O
to O
collapse O
if O
the O
plants O
are O
in O
them O
too O
long O
. O

They O
are O
 O
quite O
useful O
for O
plants O
that O
are O
despatched O
to O
market O
or O
direct O
to O
customers O
, O
their O
cheapness O
making O
them O
attractive O
to O
the O
nurseryman O
; O
there O
is O
also O
considerable O
saving O
in O
carriage O
costs O
because O
of O
their O
lightness O
. O

There O
are O
many O
types O
of O
plastic O
pots O
available O
; O
some O
expensive O
, O
some O
quite O
cheap O
; O
some O
good O
and O
others O
not O
so O
good O
. O

A O
wide O
range O
of O
plants O
grow O
quite O
well O
in O
plastic O
pots O
and O
usually O
need O
less O
water O
than O
those O
in O
clay O
pots O
. O

They O
are O
slightly O
more O
difficult O
to O
manage O
, O
however O
, O
until O
a O
little O
experience O
has O
been O
gained O
with O
them O
. O

Plastic O
pots O
are O
usually O
more O
expensive O
than O
clay O
ones O
, O
but O
they O
are O
almost O
indestructible O
and O
will O
last O
a O
long O
time O
with O
normal O
care O
. O

The O
job O
of O
the O
teacher O
is O
to O
set O
the O
learner's O
vocabulary O
to O
work O
on O
the O
existing O
store O
so O
as O
to O
make O
it O
grow O
. O

He O
does O
not O
simply O
pack O
new O
things O
into O
the O
store O
. O

The O
solitary O
learner O
has O
to O
find O
out O
how O
to O
do O
this O
for O
himself O
, O
with O
the O
help O
of O
books O
. O

He O
uses O
his O
vocabulary O
to O
ask O
questions O
and O
uses O
the O
books O
to O
find O
the O
answers O
. O

Thus O
learning O
how O
to O
learn O
means O
becoming O
your O
own O
philosopher O
, O
your O
own O
psychologist O
and O
your O
own O
teacher O
. O

You O
will O
then O
be O
a O
well-established O
learner O
and O
the O
world O
will O
be O
at O
your O
feet O
. O

Although O
the O
word O
" O
mind O
" O
has O
given O
rise O
to O
endless O
controversy O
among O
philosophers O
and O
psycho- O
logists O
, O
many O
of O
whom O
would O
like O
to O
abolish O
it O
from O
the O
dictionary O
, O
most O
of O
us O
obstinately O
go O
on O
using O
it O
. O

And O
then O
you O
get O
a O
knock O
on O
the O
head O
and O
all O
evidence O
of O
" O
mind O
" O
vanishes O
, O
at O
any O
rate O
for O
some O
time O
. O

It O
seems O
very O
difficult O
to O
detach O
the O
mind O
from O
the O
brain O
, O
and O
all O
the O
biological O
, O
surgical O
and O
pharmacological O
evidence O
points O
to O
a O
very O
close O
connection O
. O

There O
is O
a O
lot O
to O
be O
said O
for O
keeping O
the O
word O
" O
soul O
" O
to O
stand O
for O
what O
many O
believe O
to O
be O
the O
imperishable O
essence O
of O
a O
man O
which O
is O
supposed O
to O
persist O
apart O
from O
the O
body O
, O
and O
to O
reserve O
the O
more O
prosaic O
word O
" O
mind O
" O
for O
the O
basis O
of O
all O
those O
experiences O
and O
phenomena O
which O
are O
clearly O
associated O
with O
the O
brain O
. O

Can O
we O
now O
put O
forward O
any O
reasonably O
clear O
picture O
of O
this O
" O
basis O
" O
of O
mental O
phenomena O
? O

The O
physicists O
have O
succeeded O
remarkably O
well O
, O
with O
the O
atomic O
theory O
, O
in O
giving O
a O
clear O
and O
detailed O
picture O
of O
the O
basis O
of O
such O
material O
phenomena O
as O
chemical O
action O
, O
magnetism O
, O
the O
behaviour O
of O
gases O
and O
so O
on O
. O

Where O
has O
psychology O
got O
to O
in O
its O
theories O
of O
" O
mind O
" O
? O

Are O
there O
any O
ultimate O
units O
of O
mind O
akin O
to O
the O
atoms O
of O
matter O
? O

At O
one O
time O
it O
was O
thought O
that O
mind O
could O
indeed O
be O
analysed O
into O
discrete O
bits O
. O

These O
bits O
were O
identified O
as O
elementary O
sensations O
. O

These O
were O
thought O
to O
combine O
together O
to O
form O
compound O
experiences O
by O
analogy O
with O
the O
way O
atoms O
of O
matter O
combine O
to O
form O
molecular O
compounds O
. O

But O
this O
view O
led O
to O
too O
many O
difficulties O
and O
was O
finally O
abandoned O
. O

Nevertheless O
the O
search O
for O
basic O
units O
of O
mind O
has O
gone O
on O
and O
will O
doubtless O
continue O
, O
for O
it O
is O
the O
aim O
of O
science O
to O
discover O
ultimate O
units O
. O

We O
must O
beware O
, O
however O
, O
of O
supposing O
that O
there O
must O
be O
any O
close O
analogy O
between O
the O
units O
of O
quite O
different O
sciences O
. O

For O
example O
the O
success O
of O
the O
atomic O
theory O
in O
physics O
might O
lead O
us O
to O
suppose O
that O
the O
ultimate O
units O
of O
geometry O
must O
be O
points O
. O

It O
would O
be O
more O
correct O
to O
regard O
operations O
as O
the O
ultimate O
units O
of O
geometry O
. O

There O
have O
been O
many O
conflicting O
tendencies O
in O
psychology O
in O
its O
search O
for O
ultimate O
units O
and O
here O
we O
can O
only O
indicate O
what O
seems O
to O
be O
the O
most O
promising O
concept O
which O
is O
current O
today B-TIME
. O

It O
is O
known O
as O
the O
schema O
. O

It O
is O
not O
an O
easy O
concept O
and O
if O
I O
try O
to O
make O
it O
concrete O
it O
will O
be O
at O
the O
cost O
of O
over-simplification O
but O
even O
so O
it O
may O
be O
better O
than O
a O
meaningless O
abstraction O
. O

It O
is O
the O
tendency O
to O
get O
things O
the O
wrong O
way O
round O
. O

As O
a O
psychologist O
I O
am O
constantly O
encountering O
this O
tendency O
in O
friends O
and O
acquaintances O
. O

They O
think O
there O
is O
something O
inevitably O
" O
queer O
" O
about O
psychology O
and O
this O
feeling O
of O
queerness O
usually O
boils O
down O
to O
a O
quite O
mistaken O
belief O
that O
the O
psychologist O
first B-CARDINAL
looks O
into O
... O
This O
is O
what O
I O
mean O
by O
" O
getting O
things O
the O
wrong O
way O
round O
" O
. O

He O
is O
far O
more O
likely O
to O
find O
out O
about O
how O
his O
own O
mind O
works O
by O
looking O
at O
other O
people's O
. O

For O
although O
looking O
inwards O
( O
or O
" O
introspecting O
" O
as O
it O
is O
called O
) O
, O
is O
not O
entirely O
ruled O
out O
, O
nowadays O
most O
psychologists O
would O
agree O
that O
it O
is O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
the O
most O
unreliable O
methods O
of O
getting O
any O
precise O
information O
. O

And O
so O
they O
prefer O
objective O
methods O
. O

Since O
they O
cannot O
directly O
look O
into O
the O
mental O
processes O
of O
another O
person O
they O
observe O
his O
visible O
behaviour O
and O
then O
try O
to O
give O
theoretical O
interpretations O
of O
what O
lies O
behind O
this O
behaviour O
. O

This O
is O
no O
more O
queer O
than O
the O
method O
of O
the O
doctor O
who O
observes O
signs O
, O
and O
records O
symptoms O
, O
and O
diagnoses O
the O
inner O
states O
responsible O
for O
them O
. O

He O
may O
never O
have O
had O
the O
disease O
himself O
but O
he O
can O
nevertheless O
identify O
it O
. O

Similarly O
the O
psychologist O
has O
to O
be O
prepared O
to O
observe O
and O
make O
inferences O
about O
all O
kinds O
of O
processes O
in O
other O
people O
, O
whether O
or O
not O
they O
correspond O
with O
anything O
in O
his O
own O
experience O
. O

We O
know O
very O
little O
about O
the O
patterns O
of O
brain-activity O
which O
provide O
our O
schemas O
, O
nor O
do O
we O
need O
to O
know O
as O
far O
as O
psychology O
is O
concerned O
- O
these O
patterns O
are O
the O
concern O
of O
the O
neuro-physiologists O
. O

The O
numerically O
largest O
group O

A O

In O

of O
this O
Conference O

reflected O
not O

an O
increasing O
awareness O
of O
the O
problems O
of O
men O

nearing O

already O
in O

also O
a O
strong O
desire O
on O
the O
part O
of O
all O
concerned O
for O
concerted O
action O
towards O
preparing O
men O

for O

In O
1959 B-TIME
it O
was O
suggested O
by O
Mr. O
T. B-PERSON
M. I-PERSON
Banks I-PERSON
, O
Assistant O
Director O
of O
Education O
for O
Glasgow B-LOCATION
, O
that O
industrial O

might O
be O
ready O
to O
let O
older O
employees O
attend O
day-release O
courses O
on O
preparation O
for O
retirement O
, O
their O
wages O
paid O
for O
the O
time O
thus O
spent O
. O

An O
approach O
was O
made O
to O
about O
twenty B-CARDINAL
large O
firms O
and O
in O
Oc- B-TIME
tober I-TIME
, I-TIME
1959 I-TIME
, O
the O
first B-CARDINAL
experimental O
day-release O
course O
for O
men O
was O
organised O
. O

Eleven B-CARDINAL
students O
from O
seven B-CARDINAL
firms O
atten- O
ded O
a O
course O
on O
six B-TIME
full I-TIME
Fridays I-TIME
and O
it O
was O
made O
clear O
both O
to O
the O
men O
and O
their O
employers O
that O
the O
venture O
was O
an O
experiment O
from O
which O
the O
organisers O
hoped O
to O
learn O
as O
much O
as O
the O
participants O
. O

1 B-CARDINAL
. O

Are O
there O
differences O
in O
adjustment O
to O
ageing O
and O
retirement O
according O
to O
the O
occupational O
level O
of O
employees O
? O

2 B-CARDINAL
. O

If O
so O
, O
which O
occupational O
levels O
are O
the O
better O
or O
the O
poorer O
prepared O
for O
successful O
adjustment O
to O
retirement O
and O
in O
what O
aspects O
? O

3 B-CARDINAL
. O

Does O
the O
evidence O
obtained O
support O
a O
rationale O
for O
adapting O
a O
pre-retirement O
planning O
and O
preparation O
programme O
to O
the O
needs O
of O
older O
employees O
of O
different O
occupational O
levels O
? O

Each O
time O
you O
rehearse O
you O
will O
probably O
put O
things O
in O
a O
different O
way O
. O

All O
the O
better O
! O

- O
it O
will O
sound O
much O
more O
spontaneous O
on O
the O
occasion O
itself O
. O

Remember O
your O
four B-CARDINAL
names O
- O
have O
the O
list O
with O
you O
if O
you O
like O
- O
and O
you O
simply O
can't O
be O
flummoxed O
! O

Of O
course O
, O
in O
any O
speech O
a O
good O
start O
and O
a O
good O
finish O
are O
half B-CARDINAL
the O
battle O
. O

So O
- O
see O
the O
next O
page O
! O

Yes O
, O
they O
are O
waiting O
for O
you O
. O

But O
there O
is O
no O
need O
to O
be O
frightened O
. O

The O
audience O
will O
eat O
out O
of O
your O
hand O
- O
if O
they O
like O
what O
you O
offer O
them O
. O

A O
good O
start O
will O
put O
them O
in O
a O
good O
humour O
. O

Ladies O
and O
gentlemen O
! O

I O
'm O
afraid O
I O
have O
not O
had O
much O
experience O
of O
public O
speaking O
. O

But O
that O
's O
a O
terrible O
way O
to O
begin O
! O

Why O
tell O
them O
you O
are O
a O
novice O
? O

It O
's O
their O
interest O
you O
want O
- O
not O
their O
sympathy O
. O

And O
you O
want O
to O
get O
it O
from O
the O
word O
GO O
! O

Try O
something O
like O
this O
: O
It O
is O
said O
that O
tele- O
vision O
keeps O
people O
at O
home O
. O

But O
you O
, O
at O
any O
rate O
, O
have O
proved O
that O
wrong O
. O

And O
they O
say O
, O
too O
, O
that O
television O
makes O
its O
appeal O
to O
those O
of O
lesser O
intelligence O
. O

May O
I O
suggest O
that O
you O
have O
proved O
that O
right O
! O

Congratulations O
! O

And O
away O
you O
go O
into O
your O
speech O
. O

Take O
some O
thought O
, O
too O
, O
for O
your O
ending O
. O

Thank O
you O
for O
listening O
to O
me O
so O
patiently O
. O

A O
political O
candidate O
often O
used O
that O
finish O
. O

No O
wonder O
he O
didn't O
get O
in O
! O

Instead O
he O
might O
have O
ended O
this O
way O
: O
Well O
, O
those O
are O
my O
views O
. O

When O
he O
learned O
what O
was O
causing O
the O
commotion O
he O
became O
greatly O
alarmed O
, O
and O
after O
the O
body O
had O
been O
taken O
to O
St B-LOCATION
Thomas's I-LOCATION
Hospital I-LOCATION
it O
was O
his O
grief-stricken O
duty O
formally O
to O
identify O
Elizabeth B-PERSON
Camp I-PERSON
, O
aged O
thirty-three B-TIME
, O
the O
girl O
who O
was O
to O
have O
been O
his O
bride O
. O

There O
was O
little O
doubt O
of O
how O
she O
had O
met O
her O
death O
, O
and O
even O
less O
that O
it O
had O
been O
murder O
. O

She O
had O
been O
struck O
several O
times O
with O
a O
blunt O
instrument O
, O
and O
her O
head O
was O
smashed O
in O
. O

There O
were O
signs O
of O
a O
violent O
struggle O
, O
blood O
on O
the O
cushions O
and O
floor O
, O
and O
the O
remains O
of O
her O
broken O
umbrella O
. O

But O
a O
pair O
of O
bone O
cuff-links O
found O
in O
the O
compartment O
seemed O
to O
provide O
the O
only O
possible O
clue O
to O
the O
killer O
. O

The O
body O
was O
examined O
, O
and O
it O
was O
definitely O
established O
that O
no O
sexual O
assault O
had O
taken O
place O
. O

It O
seemed O
probable O
that O
the O
motive O
had O
been O
robbery O
, O
and O
this O
was O
further O
confirmed O
when O
a O
check O
was O
made O
with O
the O
woman's O
relations O
in O
Hounslow B-LOCATION
. O

Miss O
Camp B-PERSON
had O
been O
the O
housekeeper O
at O
the O
Good B-LOCATION
Intent I-LOCATION
, O
a O
public-house O
in O
Walworth B-LOCATION
. O

Her O
day O
off O
was O
Thursday B-TIME
, O
and O
before O
coming O
up O
to O
London B-LOCATION
in O
the O
evening B-TIME
she O
had O
called O
on O
her O
two B-CARDINAL
sisters O
, O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
whom O
lived O
at O
Hammersmith B-LOCATION
and O
the O
other O
at O
Hounslow B-LOCATION
, O
where O
she O
kept O
a O
shop O
. O

Elizabeth B-PERSON
had O
left O
Hammersmith B-LOCATION
in O
the O
late B-TIME
afternoon I-TIME
, O
and O
arrived O
at O
Hounslow B-LOCATION
around B-TIME
5 I-TIME
P.M. I-TIME
, O
where O
she O
had O
tea O
with O
her O
other O
sister O
, O
and O
then O
went O
to O
catch O
the O
7.42 B-CARDINAL
. O

Her O
sister O
saw O
her O
to O
the O
station O
, O
helping O
her O
with O
some O
of O
her O
packages O
. O

This O
sister O
was O
able O
to O
establish O
that O
she O
had O
carried O
a O
green O
purse O
and O
had O
bought O
a O
railway O
ticket O
. O

But O
both O
purse O
and O
ticket O
, O
and O
the O
packages O
, O
were O
gone O
when O
the O
body O
was O
found O
at O
Waterloo B-LOCATION
. O

Neither O
the O
sisters O
nor O
Mr O
Berry B-PERSON
thought O
it O
likely O
that O
she O
had O
been O
carrying O
much O
money O
. O

A O
porter O
at O
Hounslow B-LOCATION
supported O
the O
sister's O
statement O
that O
Elizabeth B-PERSON
Camp I-PERSON
had O
been O
alone O
in O
her O
compartment O
when O
the O
train O
left O
, O
but O
this O
did O
not O
help O
much O
, O
since O
it O
had O
made O
stops O
at O
nine B-CARDINAL
stations O
before O
Waterloo B-LOCATION
. O

The O
police O
began O
a O
systematic O
search O
of O
the O
line O
- O
no O
easy O
task O
, O
but O
one O
in O
which O
patience O
and O
method O
paid O
off O
. O

At O
a O
spot O
on O
the O
embankment O
between O
Putney B-LOCATION
and O
Wandsworth B-LOCATION
they O
found O
a O
bloodstained O
pestle O
such O
as O
chemists O
use O
, O
with O
some O
hairs O
sticking O
to O
it O
. O

The O
murder O
weapon O
, O
more O
than O
likely O
, O
and O
perhaps O
evidence O
enough O
to O
have O
brought O
a O
killer O
to O
book O
in O
modern O
times O
. O

But O
in O
1897 B-TIME
, O
alas O
! O

there O
was O
no O
fingerprint O
bureau O
, O
no O
experts O
to O
check O
and O
photograph O
any O
' O
dabs O
' O
it O
might O
have O
yielded O

It O
was O
a O
tough O
case O

accepting O
the O
likelihood O
that O
Miss O
Camp B-PERSON
had O
been O
attacked O
for O
the O
sake O
of O
robbery O
, O
they O
did O
not O
overlook O
the O
possibility O
that O
this O
might O

disguised O
another O
motive O

a O
thorough O

Dr. O
Davidson B-PERSON
said O
he O
would O
go O

over O

while O
we O

when O
we O
met O
at O
tea O
at O
the O
rectory O
after O

Dedication O

the O
Archbishop O
said O
he O
had O
been O
stopped O
by O
a O
farmer O
in O
a O
field O

He O
seemed O
rather O
indignant O
, O
but O
we O
took O
the O
episode O
without O
a O
smile O
till O
afterwards O
. O

The O
Hall O
proved O
most O
useful O
, O
especially O
in O
winter B-TIME
when O
the O
distance O
to O
the O
church O
deterred O
many O
from O
coming O
to O
Sunday B-TIME

We O
managed O
to O
furnish O
a O

appreciated O
the O
Church B-LOCATION

translated O
to O
Winchester B-LOCATION
, O
and O
Dr. O
Hubert B-PERSON
Burge I-PERSON
became O
Bishop O
of O
Southwark B-LOCATION
. O

Meanwhile O
I O
had O
been O
asked O
to O
do O
a O
bit O
of O
Diocesan O
work O
in O
connection O
with O
Higher O
Religious O
Education O
, O
and O
to O
become O
the O
Southwark B-LOCATION
Secretary O
of O
the O
Church B-ORGANIZATION
Reading I-ORGANIZATION
Union I-ORGANIZATION
. O

This O
meant O
organizing O
lectures O
and O
courses O
of O
religious O
instruction O
through O
the O
Diocese O
, O
and O
I O
also O
found O
myself O
a O
member O
of O
the O
Diocesan B-ORGANIZATION
Conference I-ORGANIZATION
, O
where O
I O
remember O
introducing O
myself O
as O
the O
incumbent O
of O
the O
highest O
church O
in O
the O
Diocese O
. O

There O
was O
a O
somewhat O
shocked O
atmosphere O
in O
some O
quarters O
, O
until O
I O
explained O
that O
my O
church O
was O
800 B-CARDINAL
feet O
high O
above O
the O
sea O
level O
! O

The O
work O
was O
growing O
pretty O
heavy O
, O
and O
we O
managed O
to O
get O
a O
stipendiary O
layman O
who O
could O
help O
among O
the O
children O
and O
young O
people O
. O

It O
was O
while O
I O
was O
at O
Tatsfield B-LOCATION
that O
I O
first B-CARDINAL
visited O
Oberammergau B-LOCATION
in O
Bavaria B-LOCATION
to O
witness O
the O
Passion O
Play O
. O

The O
place O
and O
its O
people O
were O
to O
play O
an O
important O
part O
in O
my O
life O
. O

For O
five B-TIME
years I-TIME
in O
succession O
till O
war O
broke O
out O
in O
1914 B-TIME
, O
I O
spent O
my O
summer O
holidays O
there O
and O
became O
very O
intimate O
with O
the O
people O
and O
the O
environs O
. O

Every B-TIME
year I-TIME
between O
the O
Passion O
Plays O
, O
an O
interval O
of O
ten B-TIME
years I-TIME
, O
another O
play O
would O
be O
performed O
at O
the O
small O
theatre O
in O
the O
village O
, O
when O
new O
talent O
would O
be O
discovered O
and O
trained O
. O

First B-CARDINAL
of O
all O
simple O
part-songs O
: O
I O
found O
only O
one B-CARDINAL
member O
who O
had O
any O
idea O
of O
reading O
music O
. O

This O
was O
the O
village O
doctor O
who O
was O
an O
old O
school O
friend O
at O
Clifton B-LOCATION
. O

He O
could O
sustain O
the O
tenor O
part O
quite O
well O
and O
lead O
the O
others O
. O

As O
for O
basses O
and O
altos O
the O
conductor O
had O
to O
teach O
by O
singing O
the O
parts O
with O
them O
. O

It O
was O
very O
amusing O
, O
and O
by O
the O
end B-TIME
of I-TIME
a I-TIME
few I-TIME
months I-TIME
an O
enthusiastic O
choir O
of O
men O
and O
women O
could O
render O
simple O
part-singing O
tolerably O
well O
. O

Then O
we O
went O
to O
work O
on O
Coleridge B-PERSON
Taylor's I-PERSON
' O
Hiawatha's B-PERSON
Wedding O
Feast O
. O

' O
Enthusiasm O
grew O
, O
and O
in O
a B-TIME
few I-TIME
more I-TIME
months I-TIME
we O
gave O
a O
concert O
at O
which O
the O
accompanist O
was O
the O
village O
schoolmaster O
, O
and O
the O
tenor O
solo O
' O
Onaway O
awake O
' O
was O
sung O
by O
the O
Rector O
. O

Friends O
from O
Limpsfield B-LOCATION
, O
in O
addition O
to O
the O
villagers O
, O
came O
up O
, O
and O
we O
were O
all O
happy O
. O

Very O
soon O
we O
managed O
to O
get O
a O
hut O
in O
Purley B-LOCATION
where O
soldiers O
were O
very O
welcome O
and O
the O
ladies O
organized O
a O
canteen O
. O

Life O
was O
in O
those O
years O
more O
than O
busy O
. O

We O
now O
had O
a O
vicarage O
next O
to O
the O
church O
, O
and O
I O
was O
most O
fortunate O
in O
having O
for O
eight B-TIME
years I-TIME
a O
most O
able O
and O
devoted O
housekeeper O
whom O
I O
had O
known O
well O
in O
Limpsfield B-LOCATION
where O
she O
had O
a O
house O
next O
to O
the O
church O
. O

On O
hearing O
that O
I O
was O
to O
leave O
Tatsfield B-LOCATION
and O
come O
to O
Purley B-LOCATION
she O
offered O
to O
come O
and O
look O
after O
me O
. O

She O
was O
a O
real O
treasure O
, O
of O
yeoman O
stock O
and O
clever O
in O
all O
domestic O
things O
, O
a O
widow O
who O
knew O
how O
to O
look O
after O
the O
' O
boy O
, O
' O
who O
was O
the O
only O
other O
occupant O
of O
the O
house O
when O
Mr. O
Evitt B-PERSON
had O
gone O
. O

We O
gathered O
together O
a O
splendid O
Sunday B-TIME
afternoon I-TIME
service O
at O
the O
church O
, O
each O
child O
being O
given O
a O
number O
which O
, O
as O
they O
came O
into O
church O
, O
they O
could O
just O
whisper O
to O
the O
superintendent O
who O
filled O
in O
the O
regi- O
ster O
at O
her O
own O
home O
. O

Each O
child O
had O
a O
picture O
given O
them O
and O
the O
lesson O
was O
largely O
based O
on O
this O
. O

It O
was O
on O
a O
stamp O
which O
could O
be O
stuck O
in O
their O
book O
, O
and O
there O
was O
quite O
a O
clamour O
for O
back O
stamps O
if O
a O
child O
had O
to O
miss O
the O
Sunday B-TIME
Church O
from O
any O
cause O
It O
was O
quite O
amusing O
to O
see O
how O
much O
the O
children O
enjoyed O
the O
service O
, O
and O
I O
heard O
of O
parents O
or O
faithful O
nurses O
threaten O
any O
naughty O
child O
with O
the O
penalty O
of O
not O
being O
allowed O
to O
come O
to O
the O
Children's O
Church O
on O
Sunday B-TIME
afternoon I-TIME
. O

I O
hope O
the O
threat O
kept O
them O
good O
in O
the O
week B-TIME
, O
but O
anyway O
they O
were O
a O
most O
delightful O
lot O
, O
and O
it O
is O
a O
great O
joy O
to O
meet O
them O
now O
fifty B-TIME
years I-TIME
afterwards O
when O
so O
many O
are O
parents O
or O
even O
grandparents O
Speaking O
of O
churchwardens O
and O
children O
leads O
me O
at O
once O
to O
chronicle O
a O
most O
intimate O
and O
lasting O
friendship O
begun O
in O
1913 B-TIME
in O
Purley B-LOCATION
and O
continuing O
till O
old O
age O
to-day O
. O

When O
I O
went O
to O
St. B-LOCATION
Mark's I-LOCATION
, O
the O
first B-CARDINAL
contact O
I O
made O
was O
with O
the O
Vicar's O
Warden O
, O
Mr. O
F. B-PERSON
W. I-PERSON
Charlton I-PERSON
and O
his O
family O
, O
the O
youngest O
of O
whose O
three B-CARDINAL
sons O
was O
just O
coming O
into O
the O
world O
in O
this B-TIME
year I-TIME
of I-TIME
1913 I-TIME
. O

From O
then O
till O
now O
the O
acquaintance O
ripened O
into O
a O
very O
deep O
friendship O
which O
I O
have O
taken O
with O
me O
through O
all O
the O
many O
vicissitudes O
of O
a O
long O
ministry O
. O

Mr. O
and O
Mrs. O
Charlton B-PERSON
have O
been O
from O
the O
first B-TIME
difficult I-TIME
years I-TIME
of O
war O
, O
when O
most O
lives O
were O
upset O
and O
some O
tempers O
were O
easily O
frayed O
, O
the O
most O
loyal O
and O
devoted O
friends O
. O

Their O
homes O
- O
for O
since O
those O
years O
they O
have O
lived O
on O
in O
Purley B-LOCATION
- O
have O
always O
been O
havens O
of O
rest O
, O
and O
the O
welcome O
has O
never O
failed O
. O

Their O
three B-CARDINAL
boys O
, O
now O
successful O
men O
, O
were O
in O
our O
Children's O
Church O
from O
the O
outset O
, O
and O
when O
we O
don't O
see O
one O
another O
we O
do O
not O
forget O
. O

In O
those B-TIME
early I-TIME
years I-TIME
1914-18 I-TIME
, O
life O
was O
very O
full O
both O
in O
the O
parish O
and O
in O
the O
wider O
war O
activities O
. O

The O
Bishop O
, O
knowing O
that O
I O
spent O
my O
holidays O
in O
Bavaria B-LOCATION
, O
asked O
me O
if O
I O
would O
do O
something O
for O
two B-CARDINAL
wards O
at O
the O
Royal B-LOCATION
Herbert I-LOCATION
Hospital I-LOCATION
, O
full O
of O
war O
prisoners O
. O

I O
was O
very O
glad O
to O
help O
in O
this O
way O
, O
and O
visited O
them O
frequently O
, O
establishing O
at O
once O
a O
friendly O
contact O
with O
the O
Bavarian B-NORP
wounded O
who O
were O
delighted O
to O
find O
someone O
who O
knew O
their O
native O
villages O
. O

I O
could O
at O
once O
notice O
the O
great O
antagonism O
between O
the O
Bavarians B-NORP
and O
the O
Prussians B-NORP
who O
openly O
scorned O
these O
more O
simple O
country O
folk O
. O

Less O
than O
no O
response O
from O
the O
Russian B-NORP
side O
led O
one O
to O
fear O
that O
the O
event O
might O
well O
have O
the O
outcome O
that O
the O
Nazis B-NORP
evidently O
hoped O
might O
lead O
to O
disaster O
. O

Then O
there O
had O
been O
much O
talk O
of O
the O
setting O
up O
among O
the O
German B-NORP
population O
of O
a O
general O
system O
of O
" O
francs-tireurs B-ORGANIZATION
" O
, O
to O
be O
named O
" O
Werewolves B-ORGANIZATION
" O
. O

The O
Nazi B-NORP
fortress O
concept O
turned O
out O
to O
be O
nothing O
more O
than O
a O
fantasy O
. O

Thanks O
to O
the O
good O
sense O
of O
the O
front O
line O
soldiers O
, O
the O
meeting O
of O
East B-LOCATION
and O
West B-LOCATION
was O
marked O
by O
the O
use O
of O
no O
weapon O
more O
lethal O
than O
vodka O
. O

And O
the O
effect O
on O
the O
German B-NORP
people O
of O
the O
first B-TIME
ten I-TIME
years I-TIME
of O
the O
promised O
thousand B-CARDINAL
of O
Nazi B-NORP
rule O
, O
so O
far O
from O
creating O
a O
spirit O
of O
warlike O
frenzy O
, O
had O
produced O
universally O
a O
dull O
bewildered O
apathy O
. O

So O
far O
had O
our O
thinking O
led O
us O
in O
this O
matter O
of O
the O
" O
Werewolves B-ORGANIZATION
" O
that O
we O
had O
contemplated O
the O
necessity O
of O
very O
special O
precautions O
to O
guard O
the O
lives O
of O
our O
airmen O
. O

Particular O
hatred O
, O
we O
felt O
, O
was O
bound O
to O
be O
aimed O
at O
the O
representatives O
of O
those O
who O
had O
, O
over O
the B-TIME
years I-TIME
, O
spread O
such O
ghastly O
havoc O
, O
destruction O
and O
death O
over O
Germany B-LOCATION
, O
causing O
such O
wholesale O
slaughter O
among O
men O
, O
women O
and O
children O
, O
old O
and O

alike O
. O

great- O

Surely O
she O
could O

on O

Philip B-PERSON

she O
knew O

on O

nerves O

everything O
had O
gone O
over O
her O
head O
. O

It O
didn't O
really O
matter O
what O
was O

said O
because O
she O
was O
no O

a O
part O

The O
thought O
of O
Nicholas B-PERSON
haunted O
her O
, O
the O
sense O
of O
loss O
crucifying O

Her O
father's O
comment O
roused O
her O
as O
he O
said O
, O
' O
I O
was O
not O
talking O

But O
I O

be O

have O
one B-CARDINAL

had O
long O

read O

frowned O
at O
the O
provisions O

not O
only O
allowed O

to O
claim O
relief O

also O
postponed O
demanding O
the O
tax O
until O
her B-TIME
financial I-TIME
year I-TIME
was O
ended O
, O
audited O
and O
agreed O
by O
the O
Inspector O

The O
process O
could O
, O
and O
often O
did O
take O
several B-TIME
years I-TIME
. O

At O
one B-CARDINAL
point O
the O
astute O
Miss O

had O
claimed O
tax O
relief O
on O
the O
pur- O
chase O
of O
several O
mink O
coats O

, O
it O
seemed O
, O
were O
necessary O
to O
fur- O
ther O
her O
career O

Alternatively O
, O
it O
was O
reported O
, O
she O
tearfully O
claimed O
that O
the O
warm O

were O
heating O
appliances O

therefore O
susceptible O
to O
a O

The O
Between O
all O

the O
final O
agreement O
had O
been O
delayed O
long O
enough O

spend O
all O

as O
the O

jogged O
along O
the O
shiny O

twinkled O
invitingly O
at O
Cecil B-PERSON

He O
wondered O
what O
it O
contained O

Probably O
the O

of O
someone's O

smiled O
at O

bulky O

when O

was O
a O

' O

aloud O
, O
' O

' O
He O
felt O
in O

pulled O
out O

tried O
his O

a O

a O
device O
designed O

Cecil B-PERSON
searched O
in O

came O
up O

eager O
hand O
inside O
, O
his O
fingers O
groping O
after O
wads O
of O
five B-CARDINAL
pound O
notes O
. O

They O
closed O
on O
a O
single O
bundle O
and O
, O
fumbling O
with O
nervous O
excitement O
, O
he O
pulled O
it O
out O
. O

His O
eye O
rested O
on O
a O
wad O
of O
stiff O
white O
paper O
printed O
on O
one B-CARDINAL
side O
. O

' O
Old O
fashioned O
fivers O
! O

' O
he O
muttered O
again O
, O
and O
tried O
to O
recall O
if O
they O
were O
still O
legal O
tender O
. O

Surely O
the O
Govr. O
and O
Compa. O
of O
the O

would O
never O
break O
their O

Cecil B-PERSON
frowned O
in O
disappointment O
as O
he O
focussed O
upon O
the O
printing O
to O
find O
no O
Govr. O
, O
no O
Compa. O
, O
in O
fact O
no O
five B-CARDINAL

at O
all O

He O
was O
holding O
a O
paper O
booklet O
, O
the O
top O
sheet O
of O
which O
bore O
, O
in O
large O
Baskerville O

, O
the O
words O

He O
ruffled O
the O
sheets O
irritably O
and O
glowered O
at O
his O
own O
breach O
of O
social O
morality O
. O

He O
climbed O
the O
stairs O
, O
eager O
to O
unload O
the O
guilt-symbol O
upon O
the O
ticket-collector O
and O
then O
to O
emerge O
carrying O
his O
shame O
unseen O
, O
but O
burning O
, O
into O
the O
night B-TIME

He O
reached O
the O
barrier O
and O
fumbled O
for O
his O
contract O
before O
thrusting O
the O
briefcase O
at O
the O
ticket-collector O
with O
the O
firm O
intention O
of O
playing O
the O
dutiful O

Before O
he O
could O
open O
his O
mouth O
, O
the O

stretched O
out O
a O

' O

The O

Cecil B-PERSON
, O
irretrievably O
laden O
with O
both O

, O
stumbled O
away O
into O
the O
darkness O

He O
nodded O
irritably O
and O
, O
turning O
his O
back O
to O
her O
, O
contrived O
to O
slide O
the O

between O

Cecil B-PERSON
gritted O
his O
teeth O
and O
glowered O
at O
the O
inequity O
of O
Miss O
Cheesecake B-PERSON
well-nigh O
bathing O
in O
tax-free O
champagne O
whilst O
he O
had O
to O
go O
easy O
on O
the O

. O

' O
What O
is O
it O
, O
Cecil B-PERSON
? O

Don't O
you O

' O
his O

asked O
solicitously O

' O
You O

I O

quite O

finished O

last B-TIME

that O

' O
Cecil B-PERSON
stepped O
towards O
the O
dining O

' O
I O
'm O
sure O
you O
must O
be O
tired O

' O
his O

You O

Now O
just O

along O

' O
Cecil B-PERSON
wriggled O
irritably O
under O
the O
misplaced O
management O
of O
a O
mother O
who O
had O
failed O
to O
realise O
that O
a O
son O
who O
is O
nearly O
bald O
is O
no O
longer O
a O
baby O
. O

He O
started O
to O
climb O
the O
stairs O
, O
stamping O
with O
unnecessary O
vigour O
upon O
the O
treads O
. O

' O
And O
don't O
wipe O
the O
dirt O
off O
on O
the O

how O

has O
a O
good O

round O

' O
There O
was O
a O
tinkle O
and O
a O
thud O
from O
beside O
the O
coat O

. O

Cecil's B-PERSON
mother O
turned O
around O
in O
time O
to O
see O
the O
briefcase O
collapse O
against O
the O
brass O
umbrella O
stand O

' O
Well O
now O
! O

' O
She O
hurried O
towards O
it O

picked O
it O
up O

' O

here O

THAT O

what O

all O
about O

' O
Cecil B-PERSON
halted O
in O
mid-step O
near O
the O
top O
of O

clenched O
his O
fists O
. O

' O
So O
that O
's O
what O
What O
's O
all O
about O

' O
he O
hissed O
without O
turning O
round O
. O

She O
pointed O
to O
the O
briefcase O
. O

' O
So O
that O
's O
why O
you O

so O
irritable O

You O
thought O
that O

He O
rushed O
down O
the O
stairs O

, O
snatching O
the O

Arnold B-PERSON
Olner I-PERSON
In O
spite O
of O
all O
the O
transferred O
maternity O
she O
was O
endowed O
with O
by O
her O
patients O
, O
poor O
Serena B-PERSON
was O
an O
infant-in-arms O
as O
a O
buyer O
of O
property O
. O

No O
, O
not O
even O
an O
infant-in-arms O
but O
a O
new-born O
babe O
, O
a O
premature O
piece O
of O
frailty O
in O
an O
oxygen- O
tent O
of O
utter O
innocence O
. O

The O
complexity O
of O
that O
innocence O
was O
colossal O
. O

It O
had O
layer O
after O
layer O
of O
illusion O
to O
be O
peeled O
off O
and O
replaced O
with O
sad O
knowledgeability O
. O

It O
was O
a O
nakedness O
of O
nai"vety O
to O
be O
clothed O
leaf O
by O
leaf O
with O
the O
disappointment O
of O
experience O
. O

Her O
first B-CARDINAL
illusion O
consisted O
in O
the O
belief O
that O
all O
she O
need O
do O
was O
to O
go O
to O
an O
agent O
, O
visit O
half B-CARDINAL
a I-CARDINAL
dozen I-CARDINAL
houses O
in O
one B-TIME
day I-TIME
, O
choose O
one B-CARDINAL
, O
make O
an O
offer O
, O
put O
it O
in O
the O
hands O
of O
a O
lawyer O
and O
go O
away O
on O
her O
holiday O
while O
the O
whole O
transaction O
was O
put O
through O
. O

Fortunately O
, O
however O
, O
the O
fashion O
for O
Victorian B-NORP
architecture O
which O
Mr. O
John B-PERSON
Betjeman I-PERSON
had O
started O
several B-TIME
decades I-TIME
before O
had O
caught O
on O
at O
last O
and O
therefore O
saved O
the O
situation O
for O
the O
affluent O
middle-class O
, O
who O
now O
had O
plenty O
of O
lovely-ugly O
to O
be O
coldly O
elegant O
in O
. O

All O
this O
Serena B-PERSON
discovered O
, O
and O
more O
, O
but O
in O
stages O
. O

For O
the O
first B-CARDINAL
thing O
she O
did O
was O
to O
make O
an O
offer O
on O
a O
small O
pink O
terraced O
cottage O
, O
two B-CARDINAL
beds O
, O
two B-CARDINAL
inter-comm. O
rec. O
, O
mod. O
k. O
and O
b. O
, O
sep. O
W.C. O
small O
back O
yard O
, O
newly O
dec. O
, O
near O
shops O
and O
tube O
The O
next O
thing O
that O
Serena B-PERSON
discovered O
was O
that O
she O
could O
not O
afford O
to O
buy O
a O
house O
at O
all O
. O

And O
this O
in O
spite O
of O
having O
at O
last O
managed O
to O
save O
the O
ten B-CARDINAL
percent O
needed O
. O

Or O
so O
she O
thought O
, O
being O
then O
in O
possession O
of O
what O
seemed O
to O
her O
the O
princely O
sum O
of O
six B-CARDINAL
hund- I-CARDINAL
red I-CARDINAL
pounds O
. O

The O
lawyer O
said O
: O
" O
Of O
course O
you O
must O
count O
about B-CARDINAL
two I-CARDINAL
hundred I-CARDINAL
for O
legal O
charges O
and O
stamp O
duties O
, O
maybe O
less O
, O
depending O
on O
the O
price O
of O
the O
house O
, O
and O
whether O
it O
has O
been O
regis- O
tered O
. O

I O
take O
it O
you O
have O
a O
mortgage O
lined O
up O
, O
then O
, O
Mrs. O
- O
er O
- O
Buttery B-PERSON
? O

" O
" O
Not O
yet O
, O
but O
the O
bank O
would O
give O
me O
a O
loan O
, O
I O
'm O
sure O
. O

" O
" O
Er O
, O
yes O
. O

You O
have O
some O
securities O
, O
then O
? O

" O
His O
aspect O
was O
as O
dusty O
as O
his O
office O
, O
with O
scurf O
from O
dusty O
hair O
on O
the O
dusty O
shoulders O
of O
his O
black O
suit O
, O
cigarette O
ash O
down O
the O
front O
, O
an O
ashen O
face O
and O
yellow O
sleepy O
dust O
in O
the O
corners O
of O
his O
pale O
grey O
eyes O
. O

His O
finger-nails O
were O
dirty O
, O
though O
he O
tried O
to O
make O
up O
for O
it O
by O
constantly O
paring O
them O
with O
the O
finger-nail O
of O
the O
opposite O
hand O
. O

" O
Yes O
, O
well O
... O
. O

" O
He O
judged O
that O
she O
had O
been O
sufficiently O
dazzled O
and O
gave O
a O
long O
raucous O
cough O
. O

" O
Only O
cigarettes O

these O

Most O
unhealthy O
, O
English B-NORP
ones O

Well O
, O
now O
, O
let O
me O
see O

I O
think O
I O
can O
put O
you O
onto O
some O
people O
who O
might O

I O
say O
might O

let O
you O
have O
a O

" O
" O
But O
, O
they O
're O
safe O
, O
are O
they O

not O

" O
" O
Mrs. O

No O

may O
trust O

that O
you O

Oh O

you O
say O
your O

yes O

that O
would O
come O
to O
... O
three B-CARDINAL
, O
carry O
seven B-CARDINAL
, O
six B-CARDINAL
nines I-CARDINAL
are O
fifty B-CARDINAL
four I-CARDINAL

of O
course O
we O
'd O
have O
to O
have O
some O
sort O
of O
proof O
, O
you O
know O
, O
it O
's O
very O
difficult O
with O
self-employed O
persons O
, O
carry O
two B-CARDINAL
. O

Yes O
. O

I O
'm O
afraid O
we O
couldn't O
raise O
this O

to O
more B-CARDINAL
than I-CARDINAL
three I-CARDINAL
thousand I-CARDINAL
three I-CARDINAL
fifty I-CARDINAL
at O
the O
most O
. O

Now O
you O
could O
get O
quite O
a O
nice O
little O
semi-detached O
house O
in O
Grimstead B-LOCATION
for O
three B-CARDINAL
thousand I-CARDINAL
, O
that O
's O
where O
I O
live O
, O
just O
before O
the O
green O
belt O
, O
lovely O
and O
modern O
, O
you O
know O

I O
forgot O
to O
tell O
you O
, O
we O
don't O
usually O
lend O
any O
house O
built O
earlier O
than O
1918 B-TIME

" O
" O
You O
see O
, O
" O
she O
propounded O
to O
Rupert B-PERSON

her O

had O
gone O
, O
" O
we O
can O
get O
three B-CARDINAL
thousand I-CARDINAL
three I-CARDINAL
fifty I-CARDINAL
, O
perhaps O
a O
little O
more O
if O
we O
can O
cheat O
your O

a O
bit O
. O

I O
'm O
sure O
you O
could O
raise O
the O

one B-CARDINAL

get O
two B-CARDINAL

a O

can O
sit O
in O
the O
autumn B-TIME
sunshine O

still O
burning O
like O
a O
half-cooled B-CARDINAL
iron O

sip O

and O
read O
the O
local O

One O
called O
La B-ORGANIZATION
Patriote I-ORGANIZATION
is O
Communist B-NORP
, O
and O
at O
the O
time O
of O
our O
arrival O
it O
was O
throwing O
huge O
over-ripe O
verbal O
tomatoes O
at O
General O
de B-PERSON
Gaulle I-PERSON
. O

One O
side O
of O
this O
square O
is O
a O
smart O
but O
modest O
bar O
called O
Pierre's B-ORGANIZATION
Bar I-ORGANIZATION
. O

For O
one B-TIME
day I-TIME
, O
with O
the O
help O
of O
the O
Syndicat B-ORGANIZATION
d'Initiative I-ORGANIZATION
, O
we O
had O
been O
hunting O
for O
furnished O
rooms O
, O
and O
had O
given O
up O
, O
when O
an O
elderly O
lady O
, O
the O
owner O
of O
a O
residence O
called O
the O
Poet's B-LOCATION
Nest I-LOCATION
, O
had O
firmly O
closed O
the O
door O
in O
our O
noses O
. O

' O
It O
is O
a O
pity O
, O
' O
said O
Mart B-PERSON
, O
' O
because O
it O
would O
have O
been O
a O
good O
address O
. O

' O
Now O
, O
after O
a O
woman's O
radar O
look O
, O
she O
decided O
Pierre B-PERSON
would O
solve O
our O
problems O
. O

This O
was O
true O
, O
Pierre B-PERSON
was O
a O
true O
Provenc*?6al O
, O
thin O
and O
yellow O
as O
lemon O
peel O
, O
wrestling O
with O
some O
gnawing O
rat O
of O
an O
illness O
, O
man O
of O
all O
trades O
, O
married O
to O
a O
commanding O
lady O
who O
loved O
small O
talk O
and O
the O
discreet O
accumulation O
of O
money O
. O

We O
went O
in O
. O

There O
were O
a O
few O
people O
in O
the O
bar O
, O
elderly O
, O
well-off O
, O
artistic O
, O
who O
, O
you O
felt O
, O
had O
made O
a O
hard O
bargain O
for O
giving O
up O
. O

' O
I O
have O
furnished O
rooms O
, O
' O
said O
Pierre B-PERSON
, O
' O
and O
all O
mod O
cons O
. O

' O
The O
price O
was O
16,000 B-CARDINAL
francs O
a B-TIME
month I-TIME
. O

' O
Yes O
, O
' O
we O
said O
immediately O
, O
even O
before O
viewing O
. O

We O
were O
shown O
around O
by O
Pierre B-PERSON
. O

The O
flat O
was O
on O
the O
third B-CARDINAL
floor O
; O
two O
rooms O
; O
soft O
Provenc*? O

and O

; O
own O
private O

. O

The O
first B-CARDINAL
night's B-TIME
sleeping O
was O
like O
a O
long O
convalescence O
. O

We O
were O
woken O
up O
twice O
about B-TIME
dawn I-TIME
by O
a O
soft O
eruption O
of O
turtle-doves O
. O

This O
was O
strange O
, O
even O
magic O
, O
because O
the O
owner's O
name O
was O
Pierre B-PERSON
Tortorolo I-PERSON
which O
, O
in O
Nicoison B-NORP
Italian I-NORP
means O
' O
turtledove O
' O
. O

Pierre B-PERSON
Turtledove I-PERSON
. O

When O
we O
woke O
up O
properly O
it O
was O
raining O
, O
an O
even O
more O
hopeless O
rain O
than O
London B-LOCATION
, O
and O
we O
looked O
out O
of O
the O
windows O
at O
the O
weeping O
trees O
and O
the O
curling O
white O
breath O
of O
the O
mountains O
. O

The O
land O
looked O
like O
a O
beaten O
woman O
and O
the O
turtle-doves O
cried O
her O
shame O
. O

There O
they O
were O
, O
in O
fact O
, O
below O
us O
, O
eight B-CARDINAL
of O
them O
. O

Four B-CARDINAL
of O
them O
were O
flattened O
on O
the O
window O
sills O
, O
two B-CARDINAL
immolated O
on O
a O
nearby O
roof O
top O
, O
the O
other O
pair O
copulating O
. O

We O
had O
a O
morning B-TIME
at O
Pierre's B-ORGANIZATION
. O

He O
talked O
about O
people O
. O

Marc B-PERSON
Chagall I-PERSON
used O
to O
live O
here O
and O
an O
Englishman B-NORP
named O
Lawrence B-PERSON
. O

He O
was O
here O
, O
near O
the O
railway O
station O
, O
three B-TIME
or I-TIME
four I-TIME
years I-TIME
. O

During O
this O
period O
he O
wrote O
a O
book O
, O
The O
Lover O
of O
Lady O
Chatterly B-PERSON
. O

No O
, O
he O
hadn't O
read O
it O
; O
Madame O
did O
all O
the O
reading O
. O

Lawrence B-PERSON
died O
in O
this O
very O
place O
. O

He O
used O
to O
come O
to O
Pierre's B-ORGANIZATION
Bar I-ORGANIZATION
again O
and O
again O
. O

No O
, O
he O
couldn't O
really O
remember O
him O
, O
he O
was O
one O
of O
the O
crowd O
. O

The O
sun O
came O
out O
; O
Mart B-PERSON
went O
shopping O
; O
I O
sat O
in O
the O
square O
reading O
the O
Patriote B-ORGANIZATION
. O

There O
was O
a O
front-page O
rear-attack O
on O
de B-PERSON
Gaulle I-PERSON
, O
and O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
paper O
was O
given O
up O
to O
murders O
, O
apart O
for O
an O
outcry O
against O
a O
proposal O
to O
drop O
radio-active O
material O
into O
the O
Mediterranean B-LOCATION
between O
Corsica B-LOCATION
and O
St B-LOCATION
Raphael I-LOCATION
. O

All O
the O
murders O
were O
well O
documented O
and O
had O
the O
air O
of O
being O
written O
by O
an O
ingenious O
, O
but O
mad O
film O
director O
of O
the B-TIME
Thirties I-TIME
. O

They O
mostly O
occurred O
in O
lonely O
farm-houses O
. O

Monsieur O
H B-PERSON
, O
for O
instance O
, O
had O
been O
clubbed O
and O
throttled O
to O
death O
by O
his O
wife O
, O
children O
and O
father-in-law O
, O
after O
muddling O
up O
some O
sheep O
while O
the O
worse O
for O
drink O
. O

The O
family O
group O
then O
sat O
down O
for O
a O
late O
lunch O
before O
the O
father-in-law O
telephoned O
the O
police O
. O

Then O
again O
, O
Monsieur O
V B-PERSON
, O
owing O
to O
family O
troubles O
, O
had O
written O
to O
the O
local O
paper O
and O
the O
superintendent O
of O
police O
, O
informing O
them O
that O
he O
was O
on O
the O
point O
Monsieur O
V's B-PERSON
house O
was O
immediately O
surrounded O
by O
firemen O
and O
other O
officials O
, O
but O
there O
was O
no O
Monsieur O
V. B-PERSON
He O
telephoned O
a B-TIME
few I-TIME
minutes I-TIME
later I-TIME
from O
a O
nearby O
village O
, O
apologising O
for O
the O
trouble O
, O
but O
explaining O
that O
the O
walls O
were O
porous O
and O
the O
gas O
had O
escaped O
. O

General O
relief O
was O
expressed O
, O
but O
Monsieur O
V B-PERSON
( O
this O
was O
actually O
reported O
in O
the O
next O
issue O
) O
returned O
home O
and O
shot O
himself O
, O
leaving O
a O
note O
which O
again O
left O
his O
household O
goods O
Some O
grim O
comic O
relief O
was O
provided O
by O
an O
elderly O
farm O
labourer O
out O
for O
a O
shoot O
who O
hid O
himself O
in O
a O
bush O
and O
imitated O
a O
blackbird O
. O

Unfortunately O
a O
sporting O
taxi-driver O
was O
after O
this O
very O
bird O
and O
shot O
the O
farm- O
labourer O
in O
the O
face O
. O

All O
, O
however O
, O
ended O
well O
, O
reported O
the O
paper O
, O
since O
the O
pellets O
were O
easily O
removed O
and O
the O
labourer O
was O
able O
to O
return O
to O
work O
the B-TIME
same I-TIME
afternoon I-TIME
. O

We O
travelled O
down O
to O
Nice B-LOCATION
on O
the O
Lambretta O
. O

You O
can O
free-wheel O
down O
a O
quarter B-CARDINAL
of O
the O
way O
. O

In O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
journey O
is O
a O
valley O
with O
a O
sea O
of O
vines O
and O
olives O
and O
beaches O
of O
earth O
pricked O
to O
blood O
by O
the O
hoe O
. O

Rising O
from O
the O
flecked O
sea O
are O
islands O
tapering O
to O
shipwrecked O
castles O
and O
towns O
, O
grey O
, O
rose-headed O
mariners O
clinging O
like O
limpets O
to O
the O
rock O
. O

There O
is O
a O
curd O
of O
morning B-TIME
smoke O
and O
a O
muffled O
bell O
taps O
the O
sky O
. O

Here O
we O
stopped O
, O
as O
in O
fine O
weather O
we O
always O
stopped O
. O

Down O
below O
is O
the O
village O
of O
Cagnes B-LOCATION
, O
but O
between O
are O
pockets O
of O
heat O
and O
cold O
like O
the O
hands O
of O
friends O
or O
strangers O
, O
and O
a O
flurry O
of O
early O
smells O
, O
the O
dark O
bosoms O
of O
beech O
and O
the O
thin O
pine O
fingers O
kissed O
by O
the O
sun O
. O

Then O
here O
was O
Nice B-LOCATION
, O
and O
the O
old O
holiday O
sea O
, O
blue O
as O
a O
new O
school O

. O

The O
same O
old O
Nice B-LOCATION
, O
creamy O
, O
vulgar O
, O
out O
of O
time O
, O
bitter-sweet O
with O
the O
ghosts O
of O
dead O
monarchs O
and O
brilliant O
prostitutes O
, O
edging O
past O
grubby O
grandeur O
to O
the O
old O
sleeping O
port O
. O

This O
, O
and O
Paris B-LOCATION
, O
were O
my O
ruined O
pavilions O
, O
and O
I O
could O
catch O
the O
taste O
of O
dead O
dreams O
on O
my O
tongue O
like O
spray O
. O

We O
parked O
the O
Lambretta O
opposite O
the O
Negresco B-LOCATION
, O
and O
went O
to O
the O
beach O
to O
have O
a O
swim O
. O

Amazing O
bedlam O
rocked O
in O
our O
eyes O
. O

The O
sea O
boiled O
with O
waves O
, O
they O
galloped O
to O
the O
walls O
and O
spumed O
over O
the O
Promenade B-LOCATION
des I-LOCATION
Anglais I-LOCATION
. O

A O
huge O
crowd O
had O
collected O
. O

There O
were O
firemen O
and O
policemen O
and O
ambulances O
, O
and O
the O
eyes O
of O
the O
spectators O
were O
hard O
with O
disaster O
. O

They O
all O
had O
that O
neat O
look O
of O
Mediterranean B-NORP
people O
to O
whom O
nothing O
could O
ever O
happen O
, O
the O
chosen O
sane O

the O
uncuckolded O

unrobbed O
, O
sheltered O
from O

and O
accident O
by O

, O
God O
and O
the O
municipality O

Yet O
, O
at O
any O
time O
now O
, O
the O
bell O
would O
ring O
for O
them O
- O
the O
gilded O
love O
house O
, O
the O
mad O
grandmother O
or O
the O
bloody O
child O
at O
the O
crossroads O
. O

It O
was O
growing O
cold O
. O

We O
left O
the O
crowd O
and O
drove O
back O
to O
Vence B-LOCATION
. O

The O
cool O
evening B-TIME
perfumes O
stood O
beckoning O
at O
the O
corners O
of O
the O
roads O
. O

Mart B-PERSON
is O
unable O
to O
smell O
( O
her O
sense O
organs O
were O
impaired O
years B-TIME
ago I-TIME
) O
, O
and O
I O
had O
to O
explain O
the O
low O
, O
sharp O
and O
sweet O
signals O
in O
the O
air O
. O

When O
we O
got O
back O
home O
we O
felt O
exhausted O
. O

London B-LOCATION
sickness O
( O
a O
sense O
of O
guilt O
, O
mingled O
with O
the O
memory O
of O
sandwiches O
We O
went O
straight O
to O
bed O
and O
slept O
until O
the O
turtle-doves O
drummed O
up O
the O
sun O
. O

The O
next B-TIME
morning I-TIME
, O
in O
the O
square O
opposite O
Pierre's B-ORGANIZATION
, O
I O
read O
about O
the O
Nice B-LOCATION
beach O
catastrophe O
in O
the O
Patriote B-ORGANIZATION
. O

Mart B-PERSON
had O
been O
right O
, O
the O
body O
had O
been O
a O
woman's O
. O

It O
belonged O
to O
a O
Madame O
N. B-PERSON
Enquiries I-PERSON
had O
been O
made O
in O
the O
neighbourhood O
, O
and O
it O
transpired O
that O
Madame O
N's B-PERSON
husband O
had O
made O
an O
arrangement O
with O
the O
dead O
lady's O
sister O
The O
sister O
, O
able O
to O
swim O
, O
had O
returned O
to O
the O
shore O
, O
but O
instead O
of O
returning O
to O
her O
brother-in-law O
( O
with O
whom O
she O
had O
an O
illicit O
relationship O
) O
, O
she O
went O
to O
her O
fiance*?2's O
house O
and O
confessed O
everything O
. O

Her O
fiance*?2 O
reported O
her O
to O
the O
police O
, O
and O
then O
jumped O
off O
a O
cliff O
near O
Monte B-LOCATION
Carlo I-LOCATION
. O

The O
day O
I O
promised O
to O
take O
Catherine B-PERSON
down O
to O
visit O
my O
young O
friend O
Philip B-PERSON
at O
his O
school O
in O
the O
country O
, O
we O
were O
to O
leave O
at O
eleven B-CARDINAL
, O
but O
she O
arrived O
at O
nine B-CARDINAL
. O

Her O
blue O
dress O
was O
new O
, O
and O
so O
were O
her O
fashionable O
shoes O
. O

Her O
hair O
had O
just O
been O
done O
. O

She O
looked O
more O
than O
ever O
like O
a O
pink O
and O
gold O
Renoir B-PERSON
girl O
who O
expects O
everything O
from O
life O
. O

Catherine B-PERSON
lives O
in O
a O
white O
house O
overlooking O
the O
sweeping O
brown O
tides O
of O
the O
river O
. O

She O
helped O
me O
clean O
up O
my O
flat O
with O
a O
devotion O
which O
said O
that O
she O
felt O
small O
flats O
were O
altogether O
more O
romantic O
than O
large O
houses O
. O

We O
drank O
tea O
, O
and O
talked O
mainly O
about O
Philip B-PERSON
, O
who O
, O
being O
15 B-TIME
, O
has O
pure O
stern O
tastes O
in O
every- O
thing O
from O
food O
to O
music O
. O

Catherine B-PERSON
looked O
at O
the O
books O
lying O
around O
his O
room O
, O
and O
asked O
if O
she O
might O
borrow O
the O
stories O
of O
Isaac B-PERSON
Babel I-PERSON
to O
read O
on O
the O
train O
. O

Catherine B-PERSON
is O
13 B-TIME
. O

I O
suggested O
she O
might O
find O
them O
dif- O
ficult O
, O
but O
she O
said O
, O
' O
Philip B-PERSON
reads O
them O
, O
doesn't O
he O
? O

' O
During O
the O
journey O
I O
read O
newspapers O
and O
watched O
her O
pretty O
frowning O
face O
as O
she O
turned O
the O
pages O
of O
Babel B-PERSON
, O
for O
she O
was O
determined O
to O
let O
nothing O
get O
between O
her O
and O
At O
the O
school O
, O
which O
is O
charming O
, O
ci- O
vilised O
and O
expensive O
, O
the O
two B-CARDINAL
children O
walked O
together O
across O
green O
fields O
, O
and O
I O
followed O
, O
seeing O
how O
the O
sun O
gilded O
their O
bright O
friendly O
heads O
turned O
towards O
each O
other O
as O
they O
talked O
. O

In O
Catherine's B-PERSON
left O
hand O
she O
carried O
the O
stories O
of O
Isaac B-PERSON
Babel I-PERSON
. O

After O
lunch O
we O
went O
to O
the O
pictures O
. O

Philip B-PERSON
allowed O
 O
it O
to O
be O
seen O
that O
he O
thought O
going O
to O
the O
pictures O
just O
for O
the O
fun O
of O
it O
was O
For O
his O
sake O
we O
chose O
the O
more O
serious O
of O
the O
two B-CARDINAL
films O
that O
were O
showing O
in O
the O
little O
town O
. O

It O
was O
about O
a O
good O
priest O
who O
helped O
cri- O
minals O
in O
New B-LOCATION
York I-LOCATION
. O

His O
goodness O
, O
how- O
ever O
, O
was O
not O
enough O
to O
prevent O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
them O
from O
being O
sent O
to O
the O
gas O
chamber O
; O
and O
Philip B-PERSON
and O
I O
waited O
with O
Catherine B-PERSON
in O
the O
dark O
until O
she O
had O
stopped O
crying O
and O
could O
face O
the O
light O
of O
a O
golden O
evening B-TIME
. O

At O
the O
entrance O
of O
the O
cinema O
the O
doorman O
was O
lying O
in O
wait O
for O
anyone O
who O
had O
red O
eyes O
. O

Grasping O
Catherine B-PERSON
by O
her O
suffering O
arm O
, O
he O
said O
bitterly O
: O
' O
Yes O
, O
why O
are O
you O
crying O
, O
he O
had O
to O
be O
punished O
for O
his O
crime O
, O
didn't O
he O
? O

' O
Cathe- B-PERSON
rine I-PERSON
stared O
at O
him O
, O
incredulous O
. O

Philip B-PERSON
rescued O
her O
by O
saying O
with O
disdain O
: O
' O
Some O
people O
don't O
know O
right O
from O
wrong O
even O
when O
its O
demonstrated O
to O
them O
. O

' O
The O
doorman O
turned O
his O
attention O
to O
the O
next O
red-eyed O
emerger O
from O
the O
dark O
; O
and O
we O
went O
on O
together O
to O
the O
station O
, O
the O
children O
silent O
because O
of O
the O
cruelty O
of O
the O
world O
. O

Finally O
Catherine B-PERSON
said O
, O
her O
eyes O
wet O
again O
: O
' O
I O
think O
its O
all O
absolutely O
beastly O
, O
and O
I O
can't O
bear O
to O
think O
about O
it O
. O

' O
And O
Philip B-PERSON
said O
: O
' O
But O
we O
've O
got O
to O
think O
about O
it O
, O
don't O
you O
see O
, O
because O
if O
we O
don't O
it O
'll O
just O
go O
on O
and O
on O
, O
don't O
you O
see O
? O

' O
In O
the O
train O
going O
back O
to O
London B-LOCATION
I O
sat O
beside O
 O
Catherine B-PERSON
. O

She O
had O
the O
stories O
open O
in O
front O
of O
her O
, O
but O
she O
said O
: O
' O
Philip B-PERSON
's O
awfully O
lucky O
. O

I O
wish O
I O
went O
to O
that O
school O
. O

Did O
you O
notice O
that O
girl O
who O
said O
hullo O
to O
him O
in O

garden O
? O
