MR. O
GAITSKELL B-PER
today B-DATE
delivered O
a O
full-blooded O
defence O
of O
the O
Polaris B-PRODUCT
missile O
base O
. O

And O
by O
implication O
he O
supported O
the O
establishment O
of O
sites O
in O
Britain B-GPE
for O
the O
training O
of O
German B-NORP
troops O
. O

His O
main O
theme O
was O
that O
nuclear O
weapons O
were O
necessary O
to O
defend O
Britain B-GPE
, O
that O
Britain B-GPE
must O
depend O
on O
Nato B-ORG
and O
" O
the O
West B-LOCATION
" O
must O
have O
nuclear O
weapons O
so O
long O
as O
the O
Soviet B-GPE
Union I-GPE
has O
them O
. O

Addressing O
the O
annual O
congress O
of O
the O
National B-ORG
Union I-ORG
of I-ORG
General I-ORG
and I-ORG
Municipal I-ORG
Workers I-ORG
, O
he O
said O
he O
felt O
sure O
the O
Labour B-ORG
movement O
was O
coming O
round O
in O
support O
of O
his O
views O
. O

Obviously O
conscious O
of O
the O
fierce O
and O
widespread O
resentment O
over O
the O
U.S. B-GPE
Polaris B-PRODUCT
base O
in O
Britain B-GPE
, O
Mr. O
Gaitskell B-PER
said O
that O
he O
even O
noticed O
that O
supporters O
of O
unilateral O
nuclear O
disarmament O
were O
changing O
their O
tactics O
by O
switching O
most O
of O
their O
emphasis O
on O
to O
the O
missile O
. O

Mr O
Gaitskell B-PER
said O
that O
a O
member O
of O
an O
alliance O
could O
not O
deny O
facilities O
to O
nations O
to O
which O
it O
was O
allied O
. O

But O
governments O
should O
be O
free O
to O
negotiate O
and O
refuse O
proposals O
with O
which O
they O
did O
not O
agree O
. O

The O
Labour B-ORG
Party I-ORG
opposed O
Thor B-PRODUCT
missiles O
, O
because O
, O
he O
said O
, O
they O
were O
out O
of O
date O
and O
vulnerable O
and O
would O
attract O
enemy O
action O
. O

That O
argument O
did O
not O
apply O
to O
the O
Polaris B-PRODUCT
submarine O
. O

So O
long O
as O
the O
Soviet B-GPE
Union I-GPE
had O
nuclear O
weapons O
, O
the O
West B-LOCATION
, O
somewhere O
, O
must O
have O
them O
too O
. O

It O
was O
far O
better O
for O
a O
weapon O
used O
for O
retaliatory O
purposes O
to O
be O
under O
the O
sea O
rather O
than O
on O
land O
. O

This O
was O
why O
the O
Labour B-ORG
Party I-ORG
did O
not O
think O
it O
right O
to O
oppose O
the O
Polaris B-PRODUCT
depot O
ship O
. O

The O
party O
agreed O
that O
it O
was O
unwise O
to O
locate O
the O
base O
in O
the O
Holy B-LOCATION
Loch I-LOCATION
, O
only B-QUANTITY
30 I-QUANTITY
miles I-QUANTITY
from O
Glasgow B-GPE
, O
a O
city O
with O
two B-CARDINAL
million I-CARDINAL
people O
. O

It O
should O
be O
sited O
in O
a O
more O
remote O
area O
. O

Mr. O
Gaitskell B-PER
added O
that O
the O
Scarborough B-GPE
conference O
decisions O
did O
not O
, O
in O
his O
view O
, O
truly O
reflect O
the O
opinions O
of O
the O
majority O
supporters O
in O
the O
country O
. O

Mr O
Gaitskell B-PER
added O
that O
agreement O
with O
the O
unilateralists O
was O
not O
possible O
, O
though O
he O
respected O
their O
views O
. O

He O
saw O
by O
reports O
recommending O
the O
supporters O
of O
unilateral O
nuclear O
disarmament O
to O
shift O
the O
emphasis O
of O
their O
intervention O
away O
from O
straight O
opposition O
to O
the O
Polaris B-PRODUCT
base O
. O

To O
Mr. O
Macmillan B-PER
, O
Mr O
Gaitskell B-PER
said O
the O
Prime O
Minister O
should O
begin O
to O
take O
seriously O
the O
danger O
of O
the O
spread O
of O
nuclear O
to O
Macmillan B-PER
that O
he O
should O
press O
, O
I O
hope O
with O
the O
agreement O
of O
Kennedy B-PER
, O
in O
talks O
with O
the O
Soviet B-GPE
Union I-GPE
, O
for O
the O
establishment O
in O
central O
Europe B-LOCATION
of O
a O
zone O
of O
controlled O
Union B-GPE
would O
be O
prepared O
to O
reach O
an O
agreement O
on O
a O
zone O
of O
controlled O
disarmament O
in O
Europe B-LOCATION
. O

Mr O
Gaitskell B-PER
concluded O
, O
declaring O
that O
the O
present O
was O
the O
beginning O
of O
a O
great O
period O
of O
opportunity O
for O
the O
party O
. O

It O
was O
a O
great O
chance O
that O
should O
be O
grasped O
. O

Inter-union O
jealousies O
prevent O
the O
fulfilment O
of O
a O
common O
policy O
for O
wages O
and O
other O
major O
questions O
, O
Mr. O
Jack B-PER
Cooper I-PER
The O
General B-ORG
Council I-ORG
of I-ORG
the I-ORG
Trades I-ORG
Union I-ORG
Congress I-ORG
should O
therefore O
consider O
the O
matter O
. O

Consideration O
should O
also O
be O
given O
to O
the O
regrouping O
of O
unions O
and O
the O
modification O
of O
their O
structures O
to O
meet O
the O
growing O
concentration O
of O
capital O
. O

Mr. O
Cooper B-PER
argued O
that O
a O
common O
industrial O
contribution O
was O
urgent O
- O
particularly O
in O
unions O
serving O
workers O
in O
the O
same O
industry O
- O
along O
Suggesting O
that O
a O
total O
T.U.C. B-ORG
membership O
of O
eight B-CARDINAL
million I-CARDINAL
was O
a O
" O
poor O
show O
" O
compared O
with O
some O
countries O
, O
he O
argued O
that O
the O
position O
needed O
examination O
. O

BEFORE O
President O
Kennedy B-PER
met O
Mr. O
Macmillan B-PER
yesterday B-DATE
morning B-TIME
he O
was O
given O
the O
views O
of O
a O
wide O
section O
of O
the O
British B-NORP
people O
about O
Polaris B-PRODUCT
submarine O
bases O
in O
this O
country O
. O

An O
open O
letter O
written O
by O
Earl O
Russell B-PER
hoping O
that O
the O
Earl O
Russell B-PER
, O
President O
of O
the O
Committee B-ORG
of I-ORG
100 I-ORG
, O
told O
Kennedy B-PER
that O
he O
should O
take O
notice O
of O
" O
that O
very O
large O
and O
growing O
section O
which O
is O
opposed O
to O
the O
establishment O
of O
a O
Polaris B-PRODUCT
base O
, O
whether O
at O
Holy B-LOCATION
Loch I-LOCATION
or O
elsewhere O
on O
British B-NORP
territory O
. O

" O
He O
pointed O
out O
that O
already O
there O
have O
been O
protests O
but O
that O
" O
very O
much O
larger O
protests O
are O
to O
be O
expected O
and O
are O
being O
planned O
. O

" O
There O
are O
three B-CARDINAL
kinds O
of O
reasons O
that O
justify O
the O
protests O
and O
these O
should O
carry O
weight O
with O
the O
U.S. B-ORG
Government I-ORG
, O
Earl O
Russell B-PER
suggested O
. O

" O
The O
first B-ORDINAL
of O
these O
reasons O
is O
the O
importance O
of O
pre- O
serving O
the O
hitherto O
cordial O
relations O
between O
the O
U.S. B-GPE
and O
Great B-GPE
Britain I-GPE
, O
not O
only O
in O
Government B-ORG
circles O
, O
but O
in O
public O
opinion O
. O

" O
Earl O
Russell B-PER
says O
it O
is O
inevitable O
, O
though O
profoundly O
regrettable O
, O
that O
the O
agitation O
against O
the O
Polaris B-PRODUCT
base O
has O
generated O
some O
antagonism O
to O
the O
policy O
of O
the O
United B-GPE
States I-GPE
. O

The O
second B-ORDINAL
reason O
is O
concerned O
with O
doubts O
as O
to O
the O
safety O
of O
the O
people O
of O
Great B-GPE
Britain I-GPE
; O
" O
in O
the O
time O
of O
crisis O
it O
would O
probably O
be O
impossible O
for O
the O
British B-NORP
authorities O
to O
exercise O
any O
degree O
of O
control O
over O
the O
action O
of O
Polaris B-PRODUCT
submarines O
. O

" O
He O
argues O
that O
there O
is O
a O
distinct O
possibility O
that O
so O
long O
as O
there O
is O
a O
Polaris B-PRODUCT
base O
in O
Britain B-GPE
the O
Soviet B-GPE
Union I-GPE
might O
retaliate O
against O
Britain B-GPE
alone O
. O

" O
Such O
retaliation O
might O
, O
and O
probably O
would O
, O
destroy O
the O
whole O
population O
of O
Britain B-GPE
in O
provoking O
American B-NORP
retaliation O
. O

Earl O
Russell B-PER
believes O
: O
" O
It O
is O
very O
questionable O
whether O
British B-NORP
membership O
of O
Nato B-ORG
and O
British B-NORP
permission O
of O
American B-NORP
bases O
on O
our O
territory O
add O
anything O
to O
the O
strength O
of O
America B-GPE
, O
while O
, O
on O
the O
contrary O
, O
they O
impose O
upon O
America B-GPE
an O
onerous O
obligation O
which O
it O
may O
prove O
impossible O
to O
fulfil O
. O

" O
The O
third B-ORDINAL
reason O
is O
that O
the O
supreme O
interest O
for O
the O
whole O
world O
- O
East B-LOCATION
and O
West B-LOCATION
and O
uncommitted O
nations O
- O
is O
the O
prevention O
of O
nuclear O
war O
. O

" O
A O
rapidly O
growing O
body O
of O
opinion O
in O
this O
country O
believes O
that O
Britain B-GPE
could O
be O
more O
effective O
in O
preventing O
a O
nuclear O
war O
as O
a O
neutral O
by O
helping O
to O
suggest O
agreements O
which O
could O
be O
accepted O
by O
both O
East B-LOCATION
and O
West B-LOCATION

would O
not O
survive O
even O
a B-TIME
few I-TIME

of O
a O

The O
best O
way O
to O
rule O

such O
a O
tragic O
contingency O
would O
be O
to O
sign O
a O

South B-GPE

while O
she O

feel O
that O
nothing O
less O
than O
the O
shock O
of O

will O
weaken O
the O
grip O
of O
Dr. O
the O
apartheid O
policy O
. O

THE O
Commonwealth B-ORG
is O
a O
multi-racial O
society O
. O

A O
policy O
of O
racial O
discrimination O
in O
any O
of O
its O
countries O
Whatever O
statesmen O
say O
at O
the O
conference O
table O
in O
London B-GPE
, O
millions B-CARDINAL
at O

would O
regard O
as O
fraudulent O
a O
Commonwealth B-ORG
which O
had O
room O
for O
a O
racist O
South B-GPE

And O
this O
is O
a O
Commonwealth B-ORG
in O
which O
five B-CARDINAL
citizens O
are O
coloured O
for O
every O
one O
who O
is O

Seen O
in O
this O
wider O
picture O
, O
a O
South B-GPE
Africa I-GPE
that O
clings O
to O

is O
a O
menace O
to O
the O
Commonwealth B-ORG
and O
a O
liability O
to O
the O
whole O
Western B-NORP
world O

A O
practical O
solution O
would O
be O
for O
the O
Commonwealth B-ORG
to O
draft O
a O
set O
of O
principles O
excluding O
race O

Certainly O

But O
it O
is O
a O
step O

grow O
brighter O

What O
it O
means O
in O
practical O

is O
that O
our O
exports O

now O
be O
a O
little O
cheaper O
for O

while O
the O

Can O
it O

Even O

it O
might O
be O
easier O

the O

Then O

Eighteen B-DATE

In O

will O
burst O
on O
to O
the O
London B-FAC
Palladium I-FAC
stage O
in O
a O
new O
show O
. O

To O
paraphrase O
his O
well-known O
ditty O
: O
" O
He O
'll O
have O
the O
limelight O
, O
they O
'll O
give O
him O
the O
girls O
- O
and O
leave O
the O
rest O
to O
him O
. O

" O
I O
have O
a O
hunch O
that O
he O
will O
feel O
more O
at O
home O
in O
the O
old O
, O
star-studded O
West B-ORG
End I-ORG
than O
he O
will O
ever O
feel O
in O
Hollywood B-ORG
. O

His O
American B-NORP
bosses O
, O
20th-Century B-ORG
Fox I-ORG
, O
have O
recently O
given O
Frankie B-PER
the O
full O
, O
razzamataz O
, O
red-carpet O
treatment O
. O

But O
they O
haven't O
done O
a O
thing O
for O
his O
film O
career O
that O
Anna B-PER
Neagle I-PER
and O
Herbert B-PER
Wilcox I-PER
were O
not O
doing O
better O
here O
, O
before O
the O
platinum-plated O
Hollywood B-ORG
carrot O
was O
dangled O
before O
his O
nose O
. O

But O
6,000 B-QUANTITY
miles I-QUANTITY
seems O
a O
heck O
of O
a O
way O
to O
go O
for O
a O
new O
hit O
song O
. O

He O
might O
be O
well O
advised O
to O
think O
hard O
and O
long O
before O
his O
next O
jump O
into O
the O
Hollywood B-ORG
arena O
. O

VERDICT O
: O
Vaughan B-PER
should O
have O
by-passed O
this O
approach O
. O

RONALD B-PER
Lewis I-PER
has O
just O
left O

a O
well-made O
variation O

to O
persuade O
the O

that O
she O
is O
out O

cheating O

VERDICT O
: O
NOT O
for O
the O

the O

rather O
large O

this O

How O
was O
it O
that O
Israel B-GPE
was O
brought O
out O
from O
under O
the O
burdens O
of O
Egypt B-GPE
? O

Because O
, O
they O
kept O
the O
Passover B-EVENT
and O
they O
were O
eating O
Matzos O
in O
Egypt B-GPE
and O
the O
" O
Feast O
of O
Matzos O
" O
was O
known O
even O
to O
Abraham B-PER
and O
Lot B-PER
. O

They O
objected O
to O
the O
word O
Confirmation O
. O

So O
the O
phrase O
' O
or O
the O
laying O
on O
of O

upon O
children O
baptized O
and O
added O
to O

Laud B-PER
made O
a O
positive O
approach O
. O

He O
set O
out O
to O
increase O
a O
sense O
of O
reverence O

The O
Prayer B-WORK_OF_ART

was O
to O
be O
respected O
and O
so O
was O
the O

not O

Lucky O
indeed O
are O
the O
families O
that O
possess O
a O
heritage O
of O
lace O

A O
lace O

handed O
down O
from O

to O
daughters O
, O
a O
lace-trimmed O
Christening O

that O
each O

wears O
in O

- O
these O
are O
proud O
possessions O
, O
linked O
to O
the O
exquisite O
lace-making O
of O
the O
past O
. O

But O
lace-making O
is O
by O
no O
means O
a O
lost O
art O
. O

It O
suffered O
a O
decline O

fell O
into O
lamentably O
low O
standards O
in O
the O
fussy O
over-furnishing O
of O
the O

it O
would O
take O
more O
than O

It O

never O

To O

as O
This O
last O
point O
is O
certainly O
important O
because O
almost O
are O
not O
only O
an O
economic O
necessity O

but O
that O
a O
great O
deal O
of O
drudgery O
can O
be O
avoided O
by O
the O
ripping O
out O
parts O
from O
hardwood O
. O

Most O
men O
would O
unhesitatingly O
use O
a O
machine O
if O
it O
Coming O
now O
to O
the O
actual O
tools O
and O
their O
cost O
, O
we O
begin O
with O
what O
we O
have O
called O
a O
bare O
minimum O
kit O
. O

Probably O
most O
men O
have O
some O
of O
the O
tools O
already O
. O

It O
will O
enable O
a O
man O
to O
make O
simple O
, O
straight-forward O
things O
, O
and O
in O
any O
case O
may O
be O
regarded O
as O
a O
good O
beginning O
to O
which O
other O
tools O
can O
be O
added O
as O
the O
need O
arises O
. O

The O
nature O
of O
the O
work O
will O
probably O
dictate O
the O
additions O
to O
be O
made O
, O
but O
as O
a O
guide O
we O
have O
given O
a O
fuller O
kit O
which O
increases O
the O
range O
of O
things O
that O
can O
be O
made O
enormously O
. O

Lastly O
, O
we O
suggest O
certain O
power O
tools O
and O
machines O
, O
the O
choice O
of O
which O
will O
depend O
partly O
upon O
the O
space O
available O
in O
the O
workshop O
, O
the O
amount O
one O
is O
prepared O
to O
pay O
, O
and O
the O
type O
of O
work O
a O
man O
normally O
does O
. O

First B-ORDINAL
, O
however O
, O
a O
word O
of O
advice O
generally O
. O

Do O
not O
buy O
so-called O
cheap O
tools O
or O
machines O
. O

They O
never O
are O
cheap O
in O
the O
long O
run O
. O

They O
may O
be O
inaccurate O
, O
Most O
tools O
have O
to O
lead O
an O
intensive O
life O
, O
and O
faults O
in O
design O
or O
quality O
soon O
become O
apparent O
. O

It O
is O
far O
better O
to O
pay O
the O
fair O
price O
for O
a O
tool O
of O
good O
To O
put O
it O
in O
a O
slightly O
different O
way O
, O
do O
not O
allow O
yourself O
to O
blame O
the O
tools O
when O
the O
job O
does O
not O
turn O
out O
quite O
right O

Soil O
blocks O
are O
probably O
the O
oldest O
alternative O
to O
clay O

for O

raising O
. O

These O
are O
compressed O
blocks O
of O
compost O
, O
made O
in O
a O
specially O
devised O
press O
to O
simulate O
roughly O
the O
shape O
and O
size O
of O
a O
pot O
. O

Usually O
cylindrical O
or O
hexagonal O
in O
shape O
, O
they O
are O
made O
of O
the O
same O
compost O
as O
would O
have O
that O
it O
is O
used O
in O
a O
slightly O
moister O
Seed O
is O
sown O
, O
or O
seedlings O
are O
pricked O
out O
into O
them O
in O
the O
normal O
way O
, O
the O
only O
real O
difference O
being O
that O
more O
of O
the O
watering O
is O
done O
through O
a O
rose O
to O
avoid O
breaking O
the O
blocks O
with O
a O

cucumbers O
, O

, O
cauliflowers O
, O

and O
onions O
, O
may O
all O
be O
raised O
in O
soil O

; O
so O
can O
such O
flowering O
plants O
as O
dahlias O
, O
chrysanthemums O
, O
salvias O
, O
sweet O
peas O
, O
lupins O
and O
numerous O
others O
. O

One B-CARDINAL
big O
advantage O
of O
soil O
blocks O
is O
an O
obvious O
one O
: O
the O
cost O
of O
a O
pot O
of O
any O
description O
is O
saved O
completely O
. O

Manufacturing O
the O
block O
and O
planting O
it O
is O
very O
little O
more O
trouble O
than O
normal O
potting O
, O
and O
a O
superior O
plant O
, O
which O
transplants O
more O
easily O
, O
is O
produced O
. O

The O
obvious O
limitation O
 O
is O
that O
soil O
blocks O
can O
only O
be O
used O
for O
propagating O
; O
there O
can O
be O
no O
progression O
to O
a O
larger O
block O
when O
the O
plant O
or O
seedling O
is O
ready O
to O
be O
moved O
; O
it O
must O
be O
planted O
out O
or O
potted O
. O

Many O
amateur O
gardeners O
might O
improve O
their O
results O
by O
buying O
a O
small O
hand-operated O
soil O
block O
maker O
and O
use O
the O
money O
saved O
on O
buying O
small O
pots O
to O
improve O
their O
composts O
. O

The O
various O
types O
of O
small O
paper O
pots O
are O
very O
useful O
for O
short-term O
operations O
, O
but O
are O
inclined O
to O
collapse O
if O
the O
plants O
are O
in O
them O
too O
long O
. O

They O
are O
 O
quite O
useful O
for O
plants O
that O
are O
despatched O
to O
market O
or O
direct O
to O
customers O
, O
their O
cheapness O
making O
them O
attractive O
to O
the O
in O
carriage O
costs O
because O
of O
their O
lightness O
. O

There O
are O
many O
types O
of O
plastic O
pots O
available O
; O
some O
expensive O
, O
some O
quite O
cheap O
; O
some O
good O
and O
others O
not O
so O
good O
. O

A O
wide O
range O
of O
plants O
grow O
quite O
well O
in O
plastic O
pots O
and O
usually O
need O
less O
water O
than O
those O
in O
clay O
pots O
. O

They O
are O
slightly O
more O
difficult O
to O
manage O
, O
however O
, O
until O
a O
little O
experience O
has O
been O
gained O
with O
them O
. O

Plastic O
pots O
are O
usually O
more O
expensive O
than O

they O
are O

It O

Suffice O
to O
say O
that O
few O

stop O
to O
marvel O
at O
the O
progress O
of O
civilisation O
which O
allows O
a O
dish O
borrowed O
straight O
from O
the O
prehistoric O
. O

How O
many O
centuries O

, O
in O
some O
cave O
or O
hilly O
hide O
, O
did O
our O
forebears O
home O
from O
the O
chase O
hold O
forth O
from O
a O
spear O
the O
welcome O
gobbet O
of O
meat O
or O
fish O
burnt O
and O
roasted O
in O
the O
homely O
and O
protecting O
flame O

How O
many O
centuries O
later O
did O
the O
mercenary O
in O
the O
Roman B-NORP
wars O
thus O
impale O
on O
pike O
or O
lance O
his O
evening O
meal O

Later O
came O
the O
thrifty O
peasant O
, O
later O
still O
the O
young O
Victorian B-NORP
buck O
adventuring O

even O
later O
our O

in O
the O

of O

latter-day O

And O
, O
if O
certain O
dishes O
and O
modes O
of O
food O
have O
persisted O
down O
the O
ages O
, O
the O
motive O
that O
preserved O
always O
been O
strong O
in O
mankind O
. O

The O
sharing O
of O
a O
meal O
in O
those O
earliest O
dangerous O
days O
was O
an O
admittance O
into O
an O
acquaintanceship O
far O
more O
important O
than O
the O
casual O

of O
the B-DATE

the O
desire O
to O
share O
something O
more O
intimate O
than O
mere O

has O
always O
been O
there O
. O

The O
truth O
is O
that O
good O
food O
offers O
a O
programme O
of O
entertainment O
almost O
unlimited O
in O
its O
variety O
and O
its O
presen- O

A O

the O

the O

When O
the O
King O

his O

required O
additio- O

funds O
, O
they O
were O
usually O
granted O
an O

collected O
by O

of O
that O

ensured O
that O
prices O

quality O

could O
be O
efficiently O
su- O
pervised O
and O
controlled O
, O
together O
with O
a O
There O
were O
two B-CARDINAL
other O
sources O
of O
public O
revenue O
- O
first B-ORDINAL
, O
the O
Church B-ORG

which O
wisely O
followed O
the O

of O
the O

its O

the O

In O
addition O
to O
these O
revenues O
, O
the O
King O
had O
the O
financial O
benefits O
of O
his O
position O
at O
the O

It O
was O
, O
therefore O
, O
a O
complicated O
and O
not O
very O
satisfactory O
financial O
system O
in O
which O
the O

But O
this O
time O
there O
was O
a O
very O
interesting O
attempt O
to O
apply O
a O
sliding O
scale O
to O
the O
payments O
demanded O
. O

The O
definition O
of O
an O
adult O
was O
altered O
to O
read O
' O
over B-CARDINAL
sixteen I-CARDINAL

, O
and O
, O
where O
the O

the O
Duke O

between O

a O
graduated O
scale O

was O
fixed O
for O

Again O
the O
resentment O
was O
widespread O
and O
the O

disappointing O
- O
a O
tax O
estimated O
to O
yield O
50,000 B-CARDINAL

the O

was O
agreed O
by O
a O

met O
at O

There O
were O
dark O
reasons O
for O
a O

so O
far O
away O

in O
a O
town O
with O
poor O
communications O

London B-GPE
was O
again O

was O
one O
of O
those O

the O
crime O

It O
is O
clear O
from O
the O
chronicles O
that O
this O
was O
a O
sordid O
quarrel O
between O
monopolists O
and O
interlopers O
. O

The O
city O
merchants O
were O
jealous O
of O
foreign O
merchants O
who O
could O
tempt O
court O
and O
baronage O
with O
rarer O
luxuries O
than O
those O
A O
sum O
of O
160,000 B-CARDINAL
was O
demanded O
- O
a O
staggering O
figure O
to O
mediaeval O
eyes O
. O

It O
was O
determined O
that O
100,000 B-CARDINAL
was O
a O
fairer O
target O
, O
and O
the O
Parliament B-ORG
agreed O
to O
find O
two-thirds B-CARDINAL
of O
this O
sum O
providing O
the O
clergy O
supplied O
the O
remainder O
. O

The O
method O
of O
assessment O
to O
which O
the O
Commons B-ORG
agreed O
was O
that O
of O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
poll-tax O
. O

The O
manifest O
injustice O
of O
this O
method O
had O
been O
to O
a O
certain O
degree O
corrected O
by O
the O
sliding O
scale O
of O
the O
second B-ORDINAL
poll-tax O
, O
but O
this O
lesson O
was O
ignored O
, O
and O
the O
injustice O
trebled O
in O
weight O
by O
a O
flat-rate O
tax O
at O
treble O
the O
rate O
- O
every O
adult O
Trebling O
the O
rate O
was O
arrived O
at O
by O
a O
simple O
The O
only O
concession O
made O
in O
view O
of O
the O
objections O
to O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
two B-CARDINAL
poll-taxes O
was O
the O
suggestion O
that O
the O
rich O
should O
help O
the O
poor O
- O
but O
this O
was O
only O
a O
pious O
hope O
because O

provided O
for O
carrying O
it O

At O
the O
time O
of O
its O

the O
heart O
becomes O
generally O

its O

its O

occur O

I O
was O
asked O
if O
I O
would O
start O
a O
village O
choral O

and O
conduct O
it O

This O
opened O
up O
a O
new O

and O
we O
plunged O
into O
it O

IN O
1913 B-DATE
Dr. O
Burge B-PER
, O
Bishop O
of O
Southwark B-GPE
, O
asked O
me O
to O
go O
as O
who O
was O
to O
become O
a O
very O
intimate O
friend O
, O
and O
I O
was O
solicitor O
cousin O
. O

As O
Bishop O
Talbot B-PER
had O
told O
me O
that O
I O
ought O
not O
to O
spend O
many B-DATE
years I-DATE
in O
Tatsfield B-GPE
, O
we O
held O
great O
family O
consultations O
. O

My O
eldest O
brother O
was O
then O
living O
in O
Limpsfield B-GPE
with O
his O
family O
, O
and O
found O
a O
very O
suitable O
house O
nearby O
where O
my O
mother O
settled O
, O
and O
eventually O
died O
in O
1926 B-DATE
at O
the O
Institution B-ORG
and I-ORG
Induction I-ORG

in O
St. B-FAC
Mark's I-FAC

This O
was O
taken O
by O
the O
Suffragan O
Bishop O
of O
Woolwich B-LOCATION
, O
a O
close O
friend O
of O
ours O

It O
was O
very O
interesting O
to O
have O
the O
privilege O
of O
filling O
such O
a O
beautiful O
building O
with O
suitable O
fittings O
; O
I O
made O
the O
architect O
, O
himself O
a O
fine O
artist O
. O

It O
is O
quite O
possible O
to O
put O
beautiful O
things O
into O
a O
beautiful O
church O
and O
yet O
spoil O
the O
building O
with O
ornaments O
unsui- O

to O
the O
environs O
. O

We O
also O
had O
a O
little O
Mission O
Hall O
leading O
off O
the O
Brighton B-FAC
Road I-FAC

in O
a O
street O
full O
of O
small O

This O
was O
called O
Ellen B-FAC
Avenue I-FAC
when O
I O
first B-ORDINAL
went O
there O
, O
but O
was O
soon O
changed O
into O
the O
better- O
were O
lots O
of O
children O
there O
, O
and O
we O
had O
a O
flourishing O
Sunday B-EVENT
School I-EVENT
and O
an O

more O
help O
both O
at O
the O
church O

Captain O

done O
very O
good O

I O
needed O
more O
help O
in O
the O
church O

the O
full O
rota O
of O
services O
on O
Sundays B-DATE

soon O
after O
I O
had O
come O
, O
and O
he O
organized O
the O
Mission O

got O
to O
know O
, O
and O
be O
known O
by O

many O
of O

A O
great O
blow O
disturbed O
all O
our O
efforts O
in O
the O
following B-DATE
the O
Forces O
were O
urgently O
needed O

and O
I O
felt O
clearly O
that O
one B-CARDINAL

us O
must O
volunteer O

The O
Bishop O
, O
Dr. O
Burge B-PER
, O
did O
not O
wish O
me O
to O
go O
then O
, O
as O
I O
had O
barely O
been O
in O
the O
parish O
was O
very O
soon O
in O
France B-GPE
where O
he O
did O
splendid O
work O
until O
his O
health O
broke O
down O
and O
he O
had O
a O
bad O
attack O
of O
enteric O
fever O

Meanwhile O
in O
Purley B-GPE
there O
was O
much O
activity O
and O
much O
At O
a O
large O
public O
meeting O
we O
launched O
the O

from O
1922 B-DATE
at O

I O
was O
continuously O
task O
involved O
a O
very O
great O
deal O

work O
for O
the O

We O
had O
a O
splendid O
body O
of O
local O

Committee B-ORG
met O
once O
a O
week O
in O
the O
evenings O
, O
and O
included O
professional O
men O
from O
every O
walk O

life O

Very O
soon O
we O
managed O
to O
get O
a O
hut O
in O
Purley B-LOCATION
where O
soldiers O
were O
very O
welcome O
and O
the O
ladies O
organized O
a O
canteen O

Life O
was O
in O
those O
years O
more O
than O
busy O

We O
now O
had O
a O
vicarage O
next O
to O
the O
church O

and O
I O
was O
most O
fortunate O
in O
having O
for O
eight B-DATE
years I-DATE
a O
most O
able O
and O
devoted O
housekeeper O
whom O
I O
had O
known O
well O
in O
Limpsfield B-GPE

she O
had O
a O

hearing O
that O
I O
was O

come O
to O
Purley B-GPE
she O
offered O
to O
come O
and O
look O

me O

She O
was O
a O
real O
treasure O
, O
of O
yeoman O
stock O
and O
clever O
in O
all O
domestic O
things O
, O
a O
widow O
who O
knew O
how O

who O
was O
the O

Speaking O

leads O
me O
at O

a O
most O

friendship O
begun O
in O
1913 B-DATE
in O
Purley B-GPE

continuing O

When O
I O
went O

the O

made O

this B-DATE
year I-DATE
of I-DATE
1913 I-DATE

Less O
than O
no O
response O
from O
the O
Russian B-NORP
side O
led O
one O
to O
fear O
that O
the O
event O
might O

the O

the O

The O

the O

Though O
Lady O
Byron B-PER
knew O
perfectly O
well O
that O
Byron B-PER
, O
as O
early O
and O
it O
came O
as O
an O

he O
had O
been O
left O
without O
the O
fortune O
that O
would O
keep O
up O

The O
questions O
about O
children O
were O
the O

in O
1951 B-DATE

except O
that O
they O
extended O
to O
all O
women O
who O
were O

had O
been O
married O

It O
was O
not O
regarded O
as O

include O
particulars O

the O
Royal B-ORG
Commission I-ORG

Nevertheless O
, O
average O
net O
family O
income O
was O
appreciably O
higher O
in O

several O

The O

between B-DATE

was O
great- O

for O

Disturbed O
by O

she O
was O
wondering O
whether O

Surely O

there O

his O

Dai B-PER
Pugh I-PER

taking O
a O
tearful O
farewell O
of O
Morfydd B-PER
Owen I-PER

Morfydd B-PER
, O
who O
had O
until O
recently O
been O
Ifor's B-PER
typist O

but O
was O
now O
returning O
to O
her O
home O
town O
as O
a O
fully-fledged O
schoolteacher O

" O
But O
I O
'm O
only O
going O
fifteen B-QUANTITY
miles I-QUANTITY
away O
, O
" O
Morfydd B-PER
was O
saying O
. O

" O
Not O
the O
end O
of O
the O
world O
, O
is O
it O
? O

" O
" O
For O
me O
it O
is O
, O
" O
Dai B-PER
said O
wretchedly O
, O
wiping O
his O
hands O
on O
his O
overalls O
preparatory O
to O
a O
last O
embrace O
. O

" O
You O
will O
not O
be O
remembering O
a O
mere O

when O
you O
are O
lording O
it O
over O
the O
Mixed O
Infants O

Llangrwl B-LOCATION

" O
" O
Silly O
boy O
, O
" O
said O
Morfydd B-PER
. O

Though O
she O
could O
not O
help O
wondering O
whether O
, O
now O
she O
had O
qualified O
as O
a O
schoolteacher O
, O
poor O
little O
Dai B-PER
was O
quite O
the O
man O
for O
her O
. O

A O
nice O
boy O
of O
course O
. O

But O
perhaps O
in O
the O
new O
world O
she O
was O
entering O
there O
might O
be O
boys O
equally O
nice O
, O
and O
with O
far O
more O
to O
offer O
. O

The O
conductor O
rang O
his O
bell O
. O

" O
Good-bye O
, O
Dai B-PER
, O
" O
said O
Morfydd B-PER
, O
smiling O
from O
the O
bottom O
step O
. O

She O
was O
already O
up O
the O
bus O
steps O
, O
and O
the O
bus O
was O
away O
. O

And O
Morfydd B-PER
Owen I-PER
waving O
, O
unkissed O
, O
from O
the O
window O
. O

And O
Dai B-PER
, O
on O
the O
pavement O
, O
knowing O
in O
his O
heart O
that O
Morfydd B-PER
was O
leaving O
him O
as O
surely O
as O
she O
was O
leaving O
Dinas B-GPE
. O

So O
the O
bus O
set O
out O
for O
Llangrwl B-GPE
. O

But O
it O
never O
reached O
there O
! O

Somewhere O
, O
on O
those B-QUANTITY
fifteen I-QUANTITY
miles I-QUANTITY
of O
mountain O
roads O

it O
disappeared O
from O
the O
earthly O

The O
first B-ORDINAL
intimation O
that O
all O

when O

He O
saluted O

left O
the O

very O
crestfallen O

Time O
passed O

The O
bus O
climbed O

and O
went O
quietly O
into O

Time O
passed O

The O
Rev. O
Edwards' B-PER
pulpit O
remained O
empty O

And O
so O
did O
the O
arms O
of O
Dai B-PER
Pugh I-PER

How O
could O
they O
be O
otherwise O

when O
his O

three-and-a- B-TIME
quarter-hour I-TIME

regular O
as O

the O

Evans I-PER
reported O
his O

it O

Very O
careless O

" O
That O
was O
their O
attitude O

Now O
if O
there O

been O
a O
good O

they O
could O
have O
measured O
up O

But O
losing O
a O

People O
were O
always O
losing O
things O

You O
'd O
be O
surprised O
, O
they O
said O

So O
it O
seemed O
, O
for O
a O
time O
, O
that O
the O
whole O
affair O
would O
be O
written O
off O
as O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
those O

like O
the O
Marie B-PER

Then O
things O
began O
to O
happen O
... O
But O
what O
about O
the O
voyagers O
? O

you O
will O
be O
asking O
. O

Well O
, O
the O
Rev. O
Edwards B-PER
had O
taken O
command O
. O

" O
Our O
position O
, O
" O
he O
said O
, O
" O
is O
somewhat O
analogous O
to O
that O
of O
a O
castaway O
on O
a O
desert O
island O

Now O
what O
does O
such O
a O
person O
do O
? O

He O
signals O
his O
position O
by O
lighting O
bonfires O
or O
hoisting O
a O
flag O
on O
a O
palm O
tree O

And O
he O
tries O
to O
ensure O
a O
supply O
of O
food O
. O

" O
Can't O
go O
lighting O
bonfires O
on O
this O
bus O

" O
the O
conductor O
said O
firmly O

" O
Contrary O
to O
the O
the O
minister O

" O
No O
, O
we O
have O
another O
way O

our O
position O

The O
driver O
must O
sound O
his O
horn O

" O
Gave O
him O

the O

" O

' O
The O
long O
afternoon B-TIME

that O

an O
afternoon B-TIME
that O
would O
somewhere O
lead O
to O

Motion O
there O
was O

motion O
without O

for O
those O

events O
that O
seemed O
so O
large O
to O
the O
creatures O
participating O
in O
them O

For O
Lily-yo B-PER
, O
Flor B-PER
and O
Haris B-PER
there O
were O
many O
events O
. O

Chief O
of O
these O
was O
that O
they O
learned O
to O
fly O
properly O
. O

The O
pains O
associated O
with O
their O
wings O
soon O
died O
away O
as O
the O
wonderful O
new O
flesh O
and O
tendon O
strengthened O

To O
sail O
up O
in O
the O
light O
gravity O
became O
an O
increasing O
delight O
- O
the O
ugly O
flopping O
movements O
of O
flymen O
on O
the O
Heavy B-GPE
World I-GPE
had O
no O
place O
here O
. O

It O
was O
all O
over O
and O
done O
with O
. O

For O
the O
time O
being O
Beryl B-PER
was O
content O
to O
let O
it O
go O
at O
that O
, O
but O
she O
resolved O
to O
have O
it O
out O
with O
Piers B-PER
when O
a O
reasonable O
opportunity O
presented O
itself O
. O

He O
must O
learn O
that O
he O
could O
not O
treat O
her O
with O
injustice O
and O
contempt O
, O
ignoring O
her O
explanations O
as O
though O
he O
were O
a O
schoolmaster O
and O
she O
a O
small O
, O
ignorant O
child O
. O

He O
gave O
her O
no O
chance O
of O
any O
private O
conversation O
that B-TIME
evening I-TIME
, O
for O
when O
Blanche B-PER
and O
Jack B-PER
left O
, O
he O
went O
with O
them O
. O

But O
next B-TIME
morning I-TIME
she O
insisted O
on O
his O
taking O
her O
out O
in O
the O
jeep B-PRODUCT
- O
to O
find O
, O
if O
possible O
, O
Hubert B-PER
and O
his O
her O
great O
disappointment O
at O
being O
held O
up O
in O
Balicou B-GPE
. O

slowly O
, O
" O
If O
you O
must O
drag O
the O
truth O
out O
of O
me O
, O
I O
must O
ask O
you O
to O
regard O
it O
as O
confidential O
. O

" O
" O
My O
dear O
Beryl B-PER
, O
don't O
tell O
me O
anything O
, O
if O
you O
'd O
rather O
not O
. O

" O
He O
was O
clearly O
startled O
by O
her O
not O
I O
, O
who O
started O
this O
conversation O
. O

" O
" O
I O
know O
. O

Absurd O
as O
it O
may O
seem O
, O
I O
didn't O
want O
you O
to O
think O
badly O
of O
me O
. O

" O
She O
turned O
away O
from O
him O
to O
fondle O
Judy B-PER
, O
who O
, O
sensing O
something O
amiss O
, O
was O
nudging O
her O
in O
the O
endeavour O
to O
if O
I O
had O
absolutely O
insisted O
on O
sailing O
at O
the O
have O
had O
it O
in O
for O
Guy B-PER
. O

You O
see O
, O
it O
was O
, O
apparently O
, O
through O
a O
mistake O
on O
Guy's B-PER
part O
that O
we O
missed O
seeing O
the O
flamingoes O
our O
first B-ORDINAL
morning B-TIME
on O
the O
island O
. O

" O
" O
What O
harm O
could O
possibly O
have O
come O
to O
Forrest B-PER
through O
Sir O
John's B-PER
nonsense O
? O

" O
Piers B-PER
could O
hardly O
have O
spoken O
with O
more O
contempt O
. O

A O
bully O
like O
that O
respects O
anyone O
who O
dares O
to O
stand O
up O
to O
him O
. O

" O
Beryl B-PER
tried O
to O
suppress O
the O
thought O
that O
this O
was O
precisely O
the O
remark O
she O
had O
made O
to O
Guy B-PER
. O

your O
knowledge O
of O
all O
the O
affairs O
of O

I O
needn't O

you O

important O

" O
" O
So O
what O
? O

You O
're O
not O
Forrest B-PER
for O
behaving O
with O
ordinary O
moral O
courage O
! O

He O
's O
quite O
capable O
of O
telling O
Sir O
John B-PER
to O
take O
himself O
and O
his O
business O
to O
an O
unmention- O
able O
destination O
. O

" O
" O
There O
's O
a O
difference O
between O
what O
a O
senior O
and O
a O
junior O
partner O
can O
do O
, O
" O
was O
her O
quick O
reply O
. O

" O
What O
they O
can O
bring O
off O
! O

I O
'll O
admit O
that O
. O

But O
Forrest B-PER
might O
at O
least O
have O
tried O
. O

He O
's O
pretty O
spineless O
! O

" O
" O
You O
think O
you O
could O
have O
carried O
more O
weight O
with O
Sir O
John B-PER
? O

" O
she O
enquired O
cuttingly O
. O

as O
- O
as O
a O
grounded O
whale O
! O

" O
He O
had O
to O
smile O
an O
attempt O

show O
my O
lady-love O
that O

put O
her O

was O

no O

" O
John B-PER
gave O
a O
short O
laugh O

" O
I O
did O

flashed O

our O

off O

We O
followed O
Nick B-PER
Dowd I-PER
into O
the O

They O
'd O
rigged O
up O
a O

Nick B-PER
Dowd I-PER

us O
a O

A O
small O

in O

I O
paused O

Shorty B-PER

The O
rest O
of O
the O
men O
there O
said O
nothing O
but O
you O
could O
see O
they O
were O
hard O
hit O

They O
were O
simple O
men O
who O
knew O
a O
lot O
maybe O
about O
digging O
for O
gold O
but O
were O
babes O
in O
arms O
when O
it O
came O
to O
dealing O
with O
owlhooters O

desperadoes O
like O
Pell B-PER

Surprisingly O
Dan B-PER
Maffrey I-PER
came O
in O
at O
sure O
asking O
for O

They O
'll O

on O
your O

We O

it O

" O
Gay B-PER
, O
a O
little O
puzzled O
, O
went O
through O
to O
the O
bar O
. O

Doc B-PER
and O
Lilyan B-PER
were O
sitting O
just O
inside O
having O
coffee O
. O

" O
Come O

join O
us O

bring O
your O
Lilyan B-PER
remonstrated O
. O

" O
They O
want O
to O
be O
tonight B-TIME

come O
and O
join O
us O
if O
you O
Gay B-PER
thanked O
him O
and O
walked O
out O
on O
to O
the O
terrace O
thinking O
that O
perhaps O
Gavin B-PER
had O
bought O
a O
drink O
and O
taken O
it O
outside O
. O

She O
looked O
round O
scanning O
the O
tables O
, O
then O
caught O
her O
breath O
, O
a O
cold O
hand O
seeming O
to O
clutch O
her O
heart O
. O

Gavin B-PER
was O
seated O
at O
a O
small O
table O
in O
a O
shadowy O
corner O
talking O
animatedly O
to O
Simone B-PER
. O

As O
Gay B-PER
watched O
he O
offered O
the O
girl O
a O
cigarette O
and O
lit O
it O
, O
his O
hands O
cupping O
Gay B-PER
stood O
irresolute O
for O
a O
moment O
, O
half B-CARDINAL
decided O
to O
go O
back O
and O
join O
Lilyan B-PER
and O
Doc B-PER
, O
while O
she O
wanted O
to O
do O
no O
more O
than O
run O
upstairs O
to O
her O
room O
, O
knowing O
that O
Gavin B-PER
although O
he O
had O
told O
her O
that O
he O
loved O
her O
, O
was O
already O
flirting O
with O
a O
girl O
that O
he O
had O
only O
met O
a B-TIME
few I-TIME
minutes I-TIME
before O
. O

but O
she O
turned O
away O
, O
giving O
a O
little O
gesture O
of O
hopelessness O
, O
knowing O
that O
her O
The O
others O
were O
all O
dancing O
and O
as O
Gay B-PER
drew O
out O
a O
chair O
and O
sat O
down O
Gavin B-PER
, O
without O
a O
word O
, O
swept O
Simone B-PER
on O
to O
the O
floor O
. O

" O
It O
doesn't O
mean O
anything O
, O
" O
Gay B-PER
told O
herself O
desperately O
, O
view O
and O
remembering O
the O
advice O
that O
Larry B-PER
had O
given O
her O
, O
while O
she O
felt O
wretched O
beyond O
words O

Neither O

Remember O
? O

" O
" O
I O
remember O

" O
quipped O
the O
houseman O
, O
meaning O
no O
offence O
, O
" O
but O
does O
he O
? O

That O
blonde O
was O
something O
. O

" O
" O
Anybody O
I O
know O
? O

" O
she O
smiled O
. O

" O
I O
think O
so O
. O

" O
No O
, O
" O
Di B-PER
said O
immediately O
. O

" O
It O
isn't O
at O
all O
important O
. O

" O
" O
Oh O
, O
he O
wasn't O
. O

His O
motor-bike O
had O
broken O
down O
outside O
and O
he O
noticed O
your O
car O
and O
then O
you O
dancing O
with O
this O
blonde O
. O

" O
" O
Really O
? O

" O
Nigel B-PER
cocked O
one B-CARDINAL
eyebrow O
. O

" O
Actually O
she O
was O
brunette O
at O
the O
roots O
and O
I O
had O
a O
redhead O
on O
the O
other O
arm O
. O

He O
would O
have O
told O
you O
this O
, O
too O
? O

" O
" O
No O
, O
" O
she O
laughed O
. O

" O
He O
didn't O
actually O
see O
you O
. O

Because O
it O
was O
your O
car O
I O
suppose O
he O
presumed O
it O
was O
you O
, O
all O
dressed O
up O
in O
" O
My O
white O
or O
my O
black O
? O

" O
Nigel B-PER
enquired O
. O

" O
Now O
I O
wonder O
which O
I O
wore O
at O
that O
particular O
surgery O
? O

" O
" O
You O
are O
a O
fool O
, O
darling O
, O
" O
Di B-PER
said O
happily O
. O

" O
I O
shall O
take O
great O
pleasure O
in O
telling O
that O
young O
man O
exactly O
what O
you O
were O
doing O
that B-TIME
evening I-TIME
. O

" O
" O
No O
, O
don't O
, O
" O
he O
said O
, O
after O
kissing O
her O
again O
. O

" O
I O
rather O
like O
to O
have O
the O
housemen O
think O
of O
me O
as O
a O
two-timing B-CARDINAL
Don B-PER
Juan I-PER
. O

I O
'm O
such O
a O
dull O
fellow O
, O
really O
. O

" O
" O
Dull O
? O

" O
She O
couldn't O
believe O
it O
. O

Self-deprecation O
was O
not O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
Nigel's B-PER
usual O
attributes O
. O

" O
You O
need O
your O
holiday O
, O
darling O
. O

I O
only O
wish O
I O
could O
go O
with O
you O
! O

" O
" O
Doctor O
I O
suppose O
? O

" O
she O
enquired O
archly O
. O

" O
No O
, O
it O
wouldn't O
! O

" O
he O
almost O
snapped O
, O
surprising O
her O
. O

" O
You O
sounded O
like O
some- O
body O
else O
for O
a O
moment O
there O

It O

Nigel B-PER

" O
I O
didn't O
mean O

I O
miserable O
enough O

in O
the O
autumn B-DATE
without O

about O

words O
. O

' O
I O
wonder O
you O
dared O
trust O
' O
Well O
! O

At O
least O
I O
know O
the O
truth O
. O

you O
are O
satisfied O
. O

And O
as O
he O
spoke O
, O
the O
thought O
vulsion O
that O
was O
homicidal O
. O

tied O
. O

He O
dare O
not O
precipitate O
what O
might O
well O
be O
another O
mantle O
, O
and O
said O
with O
such O
' O
I O
will O
leave O
you O
the O
necessary O
pre- O
his O
fountain-pen O
from O
his O
his O
 O
prescription O
pad O
, O
and O
 O
scribble O
on O
it O
. O

Then O
, O
with O
a O
gesture O
she O
knew O
so O
well O
, O
he O
tore O
off O
the O
leaflet O
and O
with O
a O
deadly O
finality O
. O

Watching O
him O
go O
, O
unable O
to O
speak O
, O
she O
felt O
that O
part O
of O
her O
was O
leaving O
him O
. O

She O
couldn't O
hate O
him O
... O
nation O
. O

Now O
there O
was O
no- O
thing O
- O
not O
even O
friendship O
. O

She O
went O
back O
to O
Philip B-PER
. O

But O
all O
she O
could O
hear O
were O
Nicholas's B-PER
Love O
. O

She O
revolted O
against O
the O
word O
. O

Nicholas B-PER
, O
Philip B-PER
... O
where O
was O
happiness O
, O
or O
peace O
of O
mind O
? O

Philip B-PER
put O
out O
a O
hand O
and O
grasped O
hers O
. O

He O
needed O
her O
. O

She O
would O
find O
solace O
in O
that O
fact O
at O
least O
. O

She O
had O
her O
truth O
. O

How O
much O
had O
built O
up O
from O
that O
first B-ORDINAL
ideal O
, O
and O
how O
hell O
lying O
there O
, O
knowing O
she O
was O
said O
instinctively O
: O
' O
I O
told O
him O
I O
knew O
he O
was O
responsible O
for O
Her O
eyes O
darkened O
in O
torment O
. O

' O
Are O
' O
Good O
heavens O
, O
darling O
, O
why O
on O
earth O
her O
word O
. O

There O
was O
enough O
evidence O
, O
no O

how O
one O
might O
want O
to O
touched O
him O
after O
the O
cold O
wind O
of O
suspense O
. O

' O
It O
will O
be O
interesting O
will O
matter O
most O
. O

' O
Strange O
how O
just O
then O
Philip B-PER
was O
so O
certain O
that O
Nicholas B-PER
would O
never O
betray O
him O
. O

He O
loved O
Sandra B-PER
too O
deeply O
to O
ruin O
her O
future O
happiness O
. O

Had O
ever O
circum- O
He O
was O
better O
; O
he O
had O
made O
a O
miraculous O
recovery O
and O
Sandra B-PER
would O
soon O
be O
his O
wife O
. O

The O
Devil B-PER
, O
he O
thought O
, O
certainly O
looked O
after O
his O
own O
. O

Something O
in O
Sandra's B-PER
attitude O
struck O
patronizing O
word O
, O
' O
she O
replied O
. O

' O
I O
despise O
Philip B-PER
bristled O
. O

' O
It O
was O
never O
our O
intention O
to O
have O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
those O
carnival O
affairs O
, O
' O
he O
retorted O
and O
in O
that B-TIME
second I-TIME
, O
he O
became O
the O
man O
of O
success O
exerting O
authority O
. O

Sandra B-PER
watched O
her O
father's O
face O
pale O
. O

Philip B-PER
, O
she O
knew O
, O
got O
on O
his O
nerves O
, O
but O
everything O
had O
gone O
over O
her O
head O
. O

It O
didn't O
really O
matter O
what O
was O
being O
said O
because O
she O
was O
no O
longer O
a O
part O
of O
it O
. O

The O
thought O
of O
Nicholas B-PER
haunted O
her O
, O
the O
sense O
of O
loss O
crucifying O
. O

Her O
father's O
comment O
roused O
her O
as O
he O
said O
, O
' O
I O
was O
not O
talking O
of O
a O
carnival O

But O
I O
presume O

shall O
be O

His O

at O
the O
time O
of O
our O
arrival O
it O
was O

at O
General O

One O
side O

this O

is O
a O

bar O
called O

Bar I-ORG

For O
one B-DATE
hunting O
for O

rooms O

and O
had O
given O
up O

when O
an O
had O
firmly O
closed O
the O
door O
in O
our O
noses O
. O

' O
It O
is O
a O
pity O
, O
' O
said O
Mart B-PER
, O
' O
because O
it O
would O
have O
been O
a O

' O
Now O
, O
after O
a O
woman's O
radar O

she O
decided O
Pierre B-PER

solve O

to O
a O

lady O
who O
loved O
small O
talk O
and O
the O
discreet O
accumulation O
of O
money O
. O

We O
went O
in O
. O

There O
were O
a O
few O
people O
in O
the O
bar O
, O
elderly O
, O
well-off O
, O
artistic O
, O
who O
, O
you O
felt O

had O
made O
a O
hard O

' O
I O

We O

The O
first B-ORDINAL
night's B-TIME
sleeping O
was O
like O
a O
long O
convalescence O
. O

We O
were O
woken O
up O
twice O
about B-TIME
dawn I-TIME
by O
a O
soft O
eruption O
of O
turtle-doves O
. O

This O
was O
strange O
, O
even O
magic O
, O
because O
the O
owner's O
name O
was O
Pierre B-PER
Tortorolo I-PER
which O
, O
in O
Nicoison B-LANGUAGE
Italian I-LANGUAGE
means O
' O
turtledove O
' O
. O

Pierre B-PER
Turtledove I-PER
. O

When O
we O
woke O
up O
properly O
it O
was O
raining O
, O
an O
even O
hopeless O
rain O
than O
London B-GPE
, O
and O
we O
looked O
out O
of O
the O
windows O
at O
the O
weeping O
trees O
and O
the O
curling O
white O
breath O
of O
the O
mountains O
. O

The O
land O
looked O
like O
a O
beaten O
woman O
and O
the O
turtle-doves O
cried O
her O
shame O
. O

There O
they O
were O
, O
in O
fact O
, O
below O
us O
, O
eight B-CARDINAL
of O
them O
. O

Four B-CARDINAL
of O
them O
were O
flattened O
on O
the O
window O
sills O
, O
two B-CARDINAL
immolated O
on O
a O
nearby O
roof O
top O
, O
the O
other O
pair O
copulating O
. O

We O
had O
a O
morning B-TIME
at O
Pierre's B-ORG
. O

He O
talked O
about O
people O
. O

Marc B-PER
Chagall I-PER
used O
to O
live O
here O
and O
an O
Englishman B-NORP
named O
Lawrence B-PER
. O

He O
was O
here O
, O
near O
the O
railway O
station O
, O
three B-DATE
or I-DATE
four I-DATE
years I-DATE
. O

During O
this O
period O
he O
wrote O
a O
book O
, O
The B-WORK_OF_ART
Lover I-WORK_OF_ART
of I-WORK_OF_ART
Lady I-WORK_OF_ART
Chatterly I-WORK_OF_ART
. O

It O
was O
growing O
cold O
. O

We O
left O
the O
crowd O
and O
drove O
back O
to O
Vence B-GPE
. O

The O
cool O
evening B-TIME
perfumes O
stood O
beckoning O
at O
the O
corners O
of O
the O
roads O
. O

Mart B-PER
is O
unable O
to O
smell O
( O
her O
sense O
organs O
were O
impaired O
years B-DATE
ago I-DATE
) O
, O
and O
I O
had O
to O
explain O
the O
low O
, O
sharp O
and O
sweet O
signals O
in O
the O
air O
. O

When O
we O
got O
back O
home O
we O
felt O
exhausted O
. O

London B-GPE
sickness O
( O
a O
sense O
of O
guilt O
, O
mingled O
with O
the O
memory O
of O
sandwiches O
the O
turtle-doves O
drummed O
up O
the O
sun O
. O

The O
next B-TIME
morning I-TIME
, O
in O
the O
square O
opposite O
Pierre's B-ORG
, O
I O
read O
about O
the O
Nice B-GPE
beach O
catastrophe O
in O
the O
Patriote B-ORG
. O

Mart B-PER
had O
been O
right O
, O
the O
body O
had O
been O
a O
woman's O
. O

It O
belonged O
to O
a O
Madame O
N. B-PER
Enquiries I-PER
had O
been O
made O
in O
the O
neighbourhood O
, O
and O
it O
transpired O
that O
Madame O
N's B-PER
husband O
had O
made O
an O
arrangement O
with O
the O
dead O
lady's O
sister O
to O
the O
shore O
, O
but O
instead O
of O
returning O
to O
her O
brother-in-law O
( O
with O
whom O
she O
had O
an O
illicit O
relationship O
) O
, O
she O
went O
to O
her O
fiance*?2's O
house O
and O
reported O
her O
to O
the O
police O
, O
and O
then O
jumped O
off O
a O
cliff O
near O
Monte B-GPE
Carlo I-GPE
. O

The O
day O
I O
promised O
to O
take O
Catherine B-PER
down O
to O
visit O
my O
young O
friend O
Philip B-PER
at O
his O
school O
in O
the O
country O
, O
we O
were O
to O
leave O
at O
eleven B-CARDINAL
, O
but O
she O
arrived O
at O
nine B-CARDINAL
. O

Her O
blue O
dress O
was O
new O
, O
and O
so O
were O
her O
fashionable O
shoes O
. O

Her O
hair O
had O
just O
been O
done O
. O

She O
looked O
more O
than O
ever O
like O
a O
pink O
and O
gold O
Renoir B-PER
girl O
who O
expects O
everything O
from O
life O
. O

Catherine B-PER
lives O
in O
a O
white O
house O
of O
the O
river O
. O

She O
helped O
me O
clean O
up O
my O
flat O
with O
a O
devotion O
which O
said O
that O
she O
felt O
small O
flats O
were O
altogether O
more O
romantic O
than O
large O
houses O
. O

We O
drank O
tea O
, O
and O
talked O
mainly O
about O
Philip B-PER
, O
who O
, O
thing O
from O
food O
to O
music O
. O

Catherine B-PER
looked O
at O
the O
books O
lying O
around O
his O
room O
, O
and O
asked O
if O
she O
might O
borrow O
the O
stories O
of O
Isaac B-PER
Babel I-PER
to O
read O
on O
the O
train O
. O

newspapers O
and O
watched O
her O
pretty O
frowning O
face O
as O
she O
turned O
the O
pages O
of O
Babel B-PER
, O
for O
she O
was O
determined O
to O
let O
nothing O
get O
between O
her O
and O
At O
the O
school O
, O
which O
is O
charming O
, O
ci- O
vilised O
and O
expensive O
, O
the O
two B-CARDINAL
children O
walked O
together O
across O
green O
fields O
, O
and O
I O
followed O
, O
seeing O
how O
the O
sun O
gilded O
their O
bright O
friendly O
heads O
turned O
towards O
each O
other O
as O
they O
talked O
. O

In O
Catherine's B-PER
left O
hand O
she O
carried O
the O
stories O
of O
Isaac B-PER
Babel I-PER
. O

After O
lunch O
we O
went O
to O
the O
pictures O
. O

Philip B-PER
allowed O
 O
it O
to O
be O
seen O
that O
he O
thought O
going O
to O
the O
pictures O
just O
for O
the O
fun O
of O
it O
was O
For O
his O
sake O
we O
chose O
the O
more O
serious O
of O
the O
two B-CARDINAL
films O
that O
were O
showing O
in O
the O
little O
town O
. O

It O
was O
about O
a O
good O
priest O
who O
helped O
cri- O
minals O
in O
New B-GPE
York I-GPE
. O

His O
goodness O
, O
how- O
ever O
, O
was O
not O
enough O
to O
prevent O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
them O
from O
being O
sent O
to O
the O
gas O
chamber O
; O
and O
Philip B-PER
and O
I O
waited O
with O
Catherine B-PER
in O
the O
dark O
until O
she O
had O
stopped O
crying O
and O
could O
face O
the O
light O
of O
a O
golden O
evening B-TIME
. O

At O
the O
entrance O
of O
the O
cinema O
the O
doorman O
was O
lying O
in O
wait O
for O
anyone O
by O
her O
suffering O
arm O
, O
he O
said O
bitterly O
: O
' O
Yes O
, O
why O
are O
you O
crying O
, O
he O
had O
to O
be O
punished O
for O
his O
crime O
, O
didn't O
he O
? O

' O
Cathe- B-PER
rine I-PER
stared O
at O
him O
, O
incredulous O
. O

Philip B-PER
rescued O
her O
by O
saying O
with O
disdain O
: O
' O
Some O
people O
don't O
know O
right O
from O
wrong O
even O
when O
its O
demonstrated O
to O
them O
. O

' O
The O
doorman O
turned O
his O
attention O
to O
the O
next O
red-eyed O
emerger O
from O
the O
dark O
; O
and O
we O
went O
on O
together O
to O
the O
station O
, O
the O
children O
silent O
because O
of O
the O
cruelty O
of O
the O
world O
. O

Finally O
Catherine B-PER
said O
, O
her O
eyes O
wet O
again O
: O
' O
I O
think O
its O
all O
absolutely O
beastly O
, O
and O
I O
can't O
bear O
to O
think O
about O
it O
. O

' O
And O
Philip B-PER
said O
: O
' O
But O
we O
've O
got O
to O
think O
about O
it O
, O
don't O
you O
see O
, O
because O
if O
we O
don't O
it O
'll O
just O
go O
on O
and O
on O
, O
don't O
you O
see O
? O

' O
In O
the O
train O
going O
back O
to O
London B-GPE
I O
sat O
beside O
 O
Catherine B-PER
. O

She O
had O
the O
stories O
open O
in O
front O
of O
her O
, O
but O
she O
said O
: O
' O
Philip B-PER
's O
awfully O
lucky O
. O

I O
wish O
I O
went O
to O
that O
school O
. O

Did O
you O
notice O
that O
girl O
who O
said O
hullo O
to O
him O
in O
the O
garden O
? O
