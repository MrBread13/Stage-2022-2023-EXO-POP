In O
this O

just O

At O

sight O
the O
difference O
between O
Souter B-PER

the O
other O
texts O
is O
rather O
large O
. O

But O
the O

the O
paragraph O
7.53-8.11 B-CARDINAL

this O

According O
to O
the O
legend O
, O
Solomon B-PER
had O
asked O
the O
the O
Shamir O
and O
Ashmodeus B-PER
told O
him O
that O
the O
Shamir O
had O
not O
been O
placed O
under O
his O
charge O
, O
as O
brought O
the O
Shamir O
to O
Solomon B-PER
from O
Eden B-LOCATION
, O
the O
Paradise B-LOCATION
, O
the O
only O
place O
where O
the O
Shamir O
could O
be O
found O
. O

The O
Talmud B-WORK_OF_ART
describes O
that O
the O
Shamir O
lives O
in O
a O
sanctuary O
, O
and O
only O
some O
rare O
birds O
know O
the O
existence O
of O
it O
. O

These O
birds O
are O
, O
the O
Cherubim O
and O
the O
Seraphim O
. O

We O
are O
also O
told O
that O
the O
Shamir O
is O
the O
stylus O
used O
by O
Moses B-PER
, O
and O
this O
stylus O
is O
described O
as O
a O
very O
precious O
diamond-stone O
and O
very O
adamant O
. O

And O
we O

That O

) O
The O
Messusah B-WORK_OF_ART
, O
which O

those O
two B-CARDINAL
lessons O

lesson O
called O
" O
the O

. O

This O
lesson O
used O
to O
be O
read O
only O
in O
the O
morning B-DATE
. O

And O
the O
Talmud B-WORK_OF_ART
tells O
a O
story O
, O
which O
is O
also O
in O
the O
Hagadah B-WORK_OF_ART
that O
Rabbi O
Eleasar B-PER
ben I-PER
Assarja I-PER
said O
, O
" O
I O
am O
nearly B-DATE
seventy I-DATE
and O
I O
had O
not O
succeeded O
that O
Ben B-PER
Zoma I-PER
said O
: O
" O

all O
the O
days O

even O
at O
night-time O

" O
( O
Berochoth B-PER
) O
And O
the O
Rabbis O
thought O
Shmah B-WORK_OF_ART
" O
to O
be O
willing O
to O
hear O
, O
" O
we O
should O
remember O
the O
Great B-WORK_OF_ART
Deliverance I-WORK_OF_ART
: I-WORK_OF_ART
Passover I-WORK_OF_ART
and O
its O
connection O
with O
the O
fringes O
( O
the O
tsitsits B-NORP
) O
. O

Leaning O
back O
carries O
the O
concealed O
message O
. O

And O
we O
were O
eating O
in O
Mitzrajim B-GPE
, O
to O
show O
they O
were O
willing O
to O
learn O
; O
and O
we O
invite O
anybody O
who O
wishes O
to O
partake O
in O

: O
" O

His O
Great O
Philosophy O
of O
the O
really O
interrogations O
to O
examine O
into O
the O
principles O
of O
the O
four B-CARDINAL
re- O
questions O
is O
seeking O
the O
opinion O
of O
the O
one O
who O
is O
conducting O
the O
Seder O
. O

In O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
place O
it O
is O
not O
a O
great O
deal O
of O
use O
telling O
even O
children O
, O
as O
I O
have O
already O
suggested O
, O
not O
to O
be O
silly O
or O
to O
pull O
themselves O
together O
. O

Far O
better O
to O
help O
them O
to O
face O
whatever O
it O
is O
that O
is O
worrying O
them O
, O
to O
find O
the O
original O
cause O
and O
then O
deal O
with O
it O
; O
show O
it O
up O
either O
for O
the O
sham O
it O
is O
- O
and O
many O
fears O
are O
based O
upon O
completely O
irrational O
pre-conceived O
notions O
- O
or O
to O
A O
little O
more O
honesty O
, O
even O
if O
one O
refrains O
from O
going O
into O
too O
many O
details O
, O
would O
help O
many O
a O
child O
to O
make O
a O
proper O
adjustment O
to O
life O
as O
it O
grows O
up O
. O

Let O
us O
look O
at O
Jesus B-PER
. O

We O
do O
not O
, O
I O
think O
, O
see O
there O
a O
life O
without O
fear O
. O

There O
are O
several O
instances O
where O
he O
seemed O
unable O
to O
go O
on O
. O

Amen O
. O

MOST O
people O
would O
probably O
regard O
tiredness O
as O
a O
purely O
physical O
thing O
. O

The O
cure O
for O
which O
is O
sleep O
. O

This O
is O
only O
partly O
true O
. O

Many O
people O
wake O
up O
tired O
of O
a O
morning O
and O
no O
amount O
of O
rest O
seems O
to O
make O
any O
difference O
. O

Sleep O
, O
to O
be O
effective O
, O
must O
be O
of O
that O
child-like O
quality O
which O
comes O
Nor O
is O
she O
necessarily O
being O
deceitful O
. O

She O
really O
did O
feel O
tired O
until O
the O
mind O
got O
the O
necessary O
injection O
of O
a O
fresh O
- O
and O
an O
attractive O
- O
interest O
! O

Tiredness O
has O
, O
therefore O
, O
as O
much O
to O
do O
with O
our O
mental O
state O
as O
with O
our O
physical O
exhaustion O
. O

A O
disturbed O
mind O
can O
bring O
the O
healthiest O
body O
to O
a O
sense O
of O
fatigue O
. O

They O
wonder O
why O
they O
get O
no O
rest O
at O
night O
, O
even O
if O
they O
do O
sleep O
. O

If O
we O
ever O
stopped O
to O
consider O
how O
much O
energy O
- O
and O
time O
- O
we O
lose O
this O
way O
in O
the O
course O
of O
a O
day O
we O
would O
be O
become O
too O
pernickety O
. O

Nevertheless O
, O
we O
could O
all O
probably O
be O
a O
little O
more O
orderly O
for O
we O
so O
frequently O
just O
muddle O
through O
. O

There O
may O
be O
some O
who O
will O
argue O
that O
routine O
destroys O
the O
soul O
. O

It O
is O
so O
easy O
, O
they O
say O
, O
to O
get O
into O
a O
rut O
. O

Save O
us O
from O
the O
school O
curriculum O
and O
even O
worse O
the O
school O
system O
whereby O
for O
meals O
everybody O
knows O
beforehand O
exactly O
what O
, O
on O
any O
given O
day O
of O
the O
week O
, O
they O
are O
going O
to O
have O
. O

If O
- O
such O
a O
critic O
may O
say O
- O
you O
are O
calling O
us O
to O
adventure O
, O
do O
not O
strangle O
us O
before O
We O
know O
from O
the O
diaries O
of O
Samuel B-PER
Pepys I-PER
that O
he O
was O
a O
great O
man O
for O
lace O
- O
paying O
as B-CARDINAL
much I-CARDINAL
as I-CARDINAL
3 I-CARDINAL
for O
a O
lace O
collar O
. O

But O
this O
didn't O
mean O
he O
was O
prepared O
to O
do O
as O
much O
for O
his O
lady O
, O
for O
he O
records O
testily O
: O
' O
My O
wife O
and O
I O
fell O
out O
about O
my O
not O
being O
willing O
to O
have O
her O
gown O
laced O
. O

' O
reign O
of O
Charles B-PER

stating O
: O
' O
Lost O

lawn O
1hand- O
kercher O
with O
a O
broad O
hem O
laced O
round O
with O
fine O
Point O
lace O
about O
four B-CARDINAL
fingers O
broad O
' O
and O
among O
the O
effects O
left O

Gwyn I-PER
is O
an O
unpaid O
bill O
for O
' O
scarlet O
satin O
shoes O
with O
silver O
lace O
' O
. O

The O
records O
of O
these O
tender O
trifles O
are O
very O
touching O
but O
then O
lace O
does O
place O
upon O
everything O
a O
delicate O
sentiment O
. O

The O
effect O
of O
bottom O
congestion O
due O
to O
the O
light O
pressure O
is O
inevitably O
mixed O
with O
that O
of O
the O
suitability O
of O
ground O
for O
spawning O
. O

Both O
result O
in O
crowding O
, O
so O
there O
is O
no O
need O
to O
try O
to O
separate O
them O
- O
thank O
Heaven O
! O

A O
good O
picture O
of O
this O
is O
seen O
on O
the O
150 B-QUANTITY
miles I-QUANTITY
of O
spawning O
grounds O
from O
the O
Viking B-LOCATION
in O
the O
north O
down O
to O
the O
Klondykes B-LOCATION
and O
the O
Reef B-LOCATION
along O
the O
western O
edge O
of O

Norwegian B-LOCATION
Deep I-LOCATION
. O

The O
East B-NORP
Anglian I-NORP
behaviour O
( O
see O
p. O
82 B-CARDINAL
) O
has O
always O
differed O
from O
that O
of O
the B-DATE
summer I-DATE
fisheries O
. O

There O
is O
the O
" O
swim O
" O
at O
slack O
waters O
, O
even O
in O
daylight O
sometimes O
; O
and O
the O
high O
swimming O
, O
when O
fish O
are O
caught O
only O
in O
the O
top B-QUANTITY
few I-QUANTITY
yards I-QUANTITY
of O
netting O
. O

These O
and O
other O
fascinating O
behaviour O
mysteries O
are O
peculiar O
to O
this O
fishery O
, O
which O
unfortunately O
seems O
to O
be O
dying O
out O
; O
but O
a O
full O
discussion O
of O
them O
is O
beyond O
the O
present O
scope O
. O

The O
Bow-wave O
Theory O
. O

This O
assumes O
that O
all O
fishing O
gear O
, O
when O
moving O
, O
sends O
before O
it O
a O
kind O
of O
scaring O
effect O
, O
probably O
through O
waves O
or O
vibrations O
in O
the O
water O
or O
along O
the O
ground O
. O

Underwater O
films O
suggest O
that O
the O
footrope O
of O
a O
trawl O
does O
this O
. O

Films O
have O
also O
shown O
plaice O
moving O
before O
a O
seine O
net O
in O
just O
the O
same O
way O
after O
being O
gathered O
inwards O
by O
the O
ropes O
. O

Even O
the O
bone O
cuff-links O
found O
beside O
the O
body O
, O
which O
had O
at O
first B-ORDINAL
been O
considered O
as O
belonging O
to O
the O
killer O
, O
proved O
yet O
another O
red O
herring O
, O
for O
it O
was O
learned O
that O
they O
had O
been O
borrowed O
by O
Elizabeth B-PER

. O

A O

been O

four B-DATE

Not O
in O
itself O
a O
crime O
, O
but O
, O
added O
to O
the O
knowledge O
that O
he O
had O
gone O
shopping O
in O
the O
town O
of O
Guil- B-GPE

for O
a O
false O

it O
left O
him O

( O
presumably O
feeling O
that O
a O

enhance O

this O
was O
accepted O

The O
two B-CARDINAL
could O
have O
joined O
this O
train O
by O
taking O
one O
from O
Victoria B-FAC
and O
changing O
at O
East B-FAC
Croydon I-FAC
. O

He O
also O
believed O
that O
they O
had O
still O
been O
together O
at O
South B-FAC
Croydon I-FAC
, O
and O
he O
remembered O
Medical O
evidence O
established O
that O
Mary B-PER
Money I-PER
had O
been O
dead O
for O
about B-TIME
an I-TIME
hour I-TIME
before O
her O
body O
was O
discovered O
, O
and O
this O
matched O
reasonably O
well O
with O
the O
timetable O
of O
the O
train O
in O
question O
. O

More O
important O
evidence O
came O
from O
a O
signalman O
at O
Purley B-FAC
Oaks I-FAC
, O
who O
had O
seen O
, O
as O
the O
train O
passed O
his O
box O
, O
a O
couple O
struggling O
in O
a O
first-class B-ORDINAL
compartment O
; O
but O
he O
seemed O
to O
have O
been O
used O
to O
seeing O
couples O
engaged O
in O
When O
, O
however O
, O
the O
Greeks B-NORP
did O
learn O
the O
art O
of O
making O
fireproof O
earthenware O
from O
the O
Egyptians B-NORP
, O
their O
cookery O
made O
rapid O
progress O
, O
because O
they O
were O
men O
of O
taste O
and O
intellect O
. O

A O
remarkable O
peculiarity O
in O
the O
banquets O
of O
the O
ancient O
world O
was O
the O
fact O
that O
they O
did O
not O
confine O
the O
resources O
of O
the O
table O
to O
the O
gratification O
of O
one B-CARDINAL
sense O
alone O
. O

Having O
exhausted O
their O
invention O
in O
the O
preparation O
of O
stimulants O
for O
the O
palate O
, O
they O
broke O
fresh O
ground O
and O
called O
another O
sense O
to O
their O
aid O
. O

By O
delicate O
application O
of O
odours O
and O
richly- O
distilled O
perfumes O
, O
these O
refined O
voluptuaries O
aroused O
the O
fainting O
appetite O
and O
added O
a O
more O
exquisite O
and O
ethereal O
enjoyment O
to O
the O
grosser O
pleasures O
of O
the O
board O
. O

The O
grati- O
fication O
of O
the O
sense O
of O
smelling O
was O
a O
subject O
of O
no O
little O
importance O
to O
the O
Romans B-NORP
. O

They O
considered O
flowers O
as O
forming O
a O
very O
and O
it O
is O
the O
opinion O
of O
Bassius B-PER
that O
far O
exceeded O
the O
number O
of O
fruits O
. O

When O
Nero B-PER
supped O
in O
 O
his O
Golden B-FAC
House I-FAC
, O
a O
mingled O
shower O
of O
flowers O
and O
odorous O
essences O
fell O
upon O
him O
; O
and O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
the O
recreations O
of O
Heliogabalus B-PER
was O
to O
smother O
his O
courtiers O
with O
flowers O
. O

Nor O
was O
it O
entirely O
as O
an O
object O
of O
luxury O
that O
the O
ancients O
made O
use O
of O
flowers O
; O
they O
were O
considered O
to O
possess O
sanative O
and O
medicinal O
qualities O
. O

According O
to O
Pliny B-PER
, O
and O
others O
, O
certain O
herbs O
and O
flowers O
proved O
of O
sovereign O
power O
in O
preventing O
the O
approaches O
of O
ebriety O
, O
or O
, O
as O
Bassius B-PER
less O
clearly O
nothing O
new O
under O
the O
sun O

but O
regarding O
foodstuffs O
the O
traveller O
occasionally O
encounters O
a O
certain O
measure O
of O
novelty O
. O

In O
China B-GPE
, O
for O
instance O
, O
dried O
rats O
are O
esteemed O
a O
delicacy O

The O
visitor O

told O
that O
they O
restore O
the O

lizards O

IN O
1913 B-DATE
Dr. O
Burge B-PER
, O
Bishop O

asked O
me O
to O
go O
as O
who O

to O
become O
a O
very O
intimate O

I O
was O

told O
me O
that O
I O
ought O
not O
to O
spend O
many B-DATE
years I-DATE
in O
Tatsfield B-GPE
, O
we O
held O
great O
family O

My O
eldest O
brother O
was O
then O
living O
in O
Limpsfield B-GPE
with O
his O
family O

and O
found O
a O
very O
suitable O
house O

my O

eventually O
died O

1926 B-DATE
at O

the O
Suffragan O
Bishop O

Woolwich B-LOCATION

a O

We O
also O
had O
a O

leading O
off O
the O
Brighton B-FAC

in O
a O

This O

changed O

soon O
after O
I O
had O
come O

and O
he O
organized O
the O

got O
to O
know O
, O
and O
be O
known O
by O
, O
many O
of O
the O
people O

the O
parish O

A O
great O
blow O
disturbed O
all O
our O
efforts O
in O
the O
following B-DATE
the O
Forces O
were O
urgently O
needed O
, O
and O
I O
felt O
clearly O
that O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
us O
must O
volunteer O
. O

The O
Bishop O
, O
Dr. O
Burge B-PER
, O
did O
not O
wish O
me O
to O
go O
then O
, O
as O
I O
had O
barely O
been O
in O
the O
parish O
was O
very O
soon O
in O
France B-GPE
where O
he O
did O
splendid O
work O
until O
his O
health O
broke O
down O
and O
he O
had O
a O
bad O
attack O
of O
enteric O
fever O
. O

The O
questions O
about O
children O
were O
the O
same O
as O
in O
1951 B-DATE
, O
except O
that O
they O
extended O
to O
all O
women O
who O
were O
or O
had O
been O
married O
. O

It O
was O
not O
regarded O
as O
practicable O
within O
the O
limits O
of O
the O
census O
to O
include O
particulars O
about O
the O
date O
of O
birth O
of O
each O
child O
, O
as O
had O
been O
done O
in O
the O
specialised O
enquiry O
for O
the O
Royal B-ORG
Commission I-ORG

After O
what O
seemed O
an O
undue O
period O
of O
repetition O
, O
the O
voice O
went O
on O
to O
describe O
the O
landing O
of O
the O
Thetan B-GPE
colony O
in O
Sussex B-GPE
, O
in O
all O
its O
obscene O
details O

Then O
the O
radio O
went O
dead O
again O
, O
and O
Steve B-PER
had O
no O
stomach O
for O
breakfast O
. O

It O
was O
a O
beautiful O
day O
, O
as O
firsts-of-June B-DATE
should O
be O
. O

Steve B-PER
got O
out O
the O
car O
and O
traversed O
the O
same O
empty O
streets O
as O
he O
had O
the O
night B-TIME
before O
, O
to O
keep O
an O
appointment O
with O
Heather B-PER

" O
Now O
, O
to O
summarize O
what O
I O
think O
our O
course O
of O
action O
should O
be O
. O

First B-ORDINAL
, O
to O
avoid O
the O
Thetans B-NORP
like O
the O
plague O
, O
for O
they O
must O
not O
find O
us O
out O
! O

Second B-ORDINAL
, O
to O
tread O
pretty O
warily O
among O
our O
own O
people O
, O
finding O
out O
just O
how O
much O
freedom O
we O
can O
take O
with O
safety O
. O

And O
third B-ORDINAL
, O
to O
study O
these O
damned O
Thetans B-NORP
. O

We O
must O
learn O
all O
we O
can O
about O
them O

After O
a O
long O
wait O
a O
bus O
appeared O
and O
they O
followed O
the O
beaming O
Dan B-PER
aboard O
, O
taking O
seats O
some O
rows O
behind O
him O

Steve B-PER
was O
beginning O
to O
find O
the O
stereotyped O
, O
flattish O
, O
happy O
faces O
very O
disconcerting O
; O
and O
looking O
at O
Heather B-PER
he O
found O
a O
welcome O
relief O
in O
her O
relatively O
long O
doleful O
one O
expenses O

with O
the O
people O
to O
whom O
Moke B-PER

Mrs O

another O

that O

a O

Morfydd B-PER

I O

Morfydd B-PER

" O
Not O

" O
" O
For O
me O
it O

Dai B-PER
said O
wretchedly O
, O
wiping O
his O
hands O
on O
his O

preparatory O
to O
a O
last O

" O
You O

" O
" O
Silly O

" O
said O
Morfydd B-PER

Though O
she O
could O
not O
help O
wondering O
whether O
, O
now O
she O
had O
qualified O
as O
a O
schoolteacher O

poor O
little O
Dai B-PER
was O
quite O
the O
man O
for O
her O

A O
nice O
boy O
of O

But O
perhaps O
in O
the O
new O

she O
was O
entering O
there O
might O
be O
boys O
equally O
nice O
, O
and O
with O
far O
more O

The O

Oh O

that O

" O
No O

back O

" O
I O

So O
you O
met O
a O

fifty B-QUANTITY

All O
lit O
up O

Full O
of O

Suddenly O

Time O

The O

quietly O

" O
That O
was O
their O

Now O
if O
there O

they O

You O
'd O

So O
it O
seemed O
, O
for O
a O
time O

that O
the O

would O
be O
written O
off O

one B-CARDINAL

the O

Then O
things O

what O
about O
the O

you O
will O
be O
asking O

Well O
, O
the O
Rev. O

had O
taken O

" O
Our O
position O

" O
he O
said O
, O
" O
is O
somewhat O
analogous O
to O
that O
of O
a O
castaway O
on O
a O

Now O
what O
does O
such O
a O
person O
do O
? O

He O
signals O
his O
position O
by O
lighting O
bonfires O

hoisting O
a O
flag O
on O
a O

And O
he O
tries O
to O
ensure O
a O
supply O
of O
food O

" O
Can't O
go O
lighting O
bonfires O
on O
this O
bus O

" O
the O

said O
firmly O

" O
Contrary O
to O
the O
the O

" O
No O
, O
we O
have O
another O
way O
of O

our O
position O

The O

must O
sound O
his O
horn O
continuously O

" O
Gave O
him O
a O
look O

the O

did O

" O
Where O

nothing O

you O
could O

they O
were O
hard O

They O
were O
simple O
men O
who O
knew O
a O

about O

Gavin B-PER

Just O

nodded O

" O
I O

" O
Gay B-PER
laughed O
, O
Doc B-PER
was O
so O
kind O

nice O
and O
she O
hoped O
that O
one B-CARDINAL

she O
would O
be O
able O

the O

sat O
on O

At O
one B-CARDINAL

put O
St. B-ORG

Casualty I-ORG
Department I-ORG
out O
of O
operation O

in O
theory O
, O
at O

. O

She O
would O
think O
of O
her- O
self O
as O
a O
stranger O
in O
these O
parts O
man O
of O
the O
road O
his O
freedom O

" O
" O
I O

the O

does O
he O

something O

I O

" O
No O

" O
Di B-PER
said O
immediately O

" O
It O
isn't O
at O
all O
important O

" O
But O
after O
that O
slight O
slip O
of O
the O
tongue O
on O
Nigel's B-PER
part O
she O
had O
realised O
it O
was O
important O
enough O
for O
her O
to O
have O
remembered O
, O
and O
it O
was O
as O
though O
a O
red O
mist O
veiled O
her O
usually O
clear O

made O
her O
think O
there O
was O
an O
abyss O
immediately O
ahead O
. O

" O
Nigel B-PER
, O
" O
she O
had O
besought O
him O
, O
" O
you O
know O
that B-TIME
evening I-TIME
you O
took O
Luke B-PER
Parson's I-PER
surgery O
and O
there O
was O
a O
woman O
with O
a O
cyst O
on O
her O
ear O
... O
? O

" O
" O
Oh O
, O
he O
wasn't O
. O

His O
motor-bike O
had O
broken O
down O
outside O
and O
he O
noticed O
your O
car O
and O
then O
you O
dancing O
with O
this O
blonde O
. O

" O
" O
Really O
? O

" O
Nigel B-PER
cocked O
one B-CARDINAL
eyebrow O
. O

" O
Actually O
she O
was O
brunette O
at O
the O
roots O
and O
I O
had O
a O
redhead O
on O
the O
other O
arm O
. O

He O
would O
have O
told O
you O
this O
, O
too O
? O

" O
" O
No O
, O
" O
she O
laughed O
. O

" O
He O
didn't O
actually O
see O
you O
. O

Because O
it O
was O
your O
car O
I O
suppose O
he O
presumed O
it O
was O
you O
, O
all O
dressed O
up O
in O
" O
My O
white O
or O
my O
black O
? O

" O
Nigel B-PER
enquired O
. O

" O
Now O
I O
wonder O
which O
I O
wore O
at O
that O
particular O
surgery O
? O

" O
" O
You O
are O
a O
fool O
, O
darling O

" O
Di B-PER
said O
happily O
. O

" O
I O
shall O
take O
great O
pleasure O
in O
telling O
that O
young O
man O
exactly O
what O
you O
were O
doing O
that B-TIME
evening I-TIME
. O

" O
" O
No O
, O
don't O
, O
" O
he O
said O
, O
after O
kissing O
her O
again O
. O

" O
I O
rather O
like O
to O
have O
the O
housemen O
think O
of O
me O
as O
a O
two-timing B-CARDINAL

such O
a O
dull O

" O
Dull O
? O

" O
She O
couldn't O

it O

Self-deprecation O
was O
not O

of O

usual O
attributes O

she O
enquired O
archly O

" O
No O

it O
wouldn't O

" O
he O
almost O
snapped O
, O
surprising O
her O

" O
You O
sounded O
like O
some- O

for O
a O

there O

" O
" O
Nigel B-PER

she O
gasped O

" O
I O
didn't O

I O
can't O

you O
up O

You O
wish O
you O
could O
come O

you O
hope O
I O
'll O
miss O
you O
; O
you O
can't O
imagine O
the O
hospital O
without O
me O
for O
Her O
figure O
was O
small O
and O
exquisite O
, O
like O
a O
schoolgirl's O
still O
, O
and O
he O
admired O
her O
legs O
, O
which O
the O
male O
sex O
were O
inclined O
to O
regard O
first B-ORDINAL
. O

" O
I O
would O
mind O
if O
you O
didn't O
" O
he O
told O
her O
grimly O
, O
and O
tugged O
her O
fiercely O
into O
his O
arms O
. O

" O
You O
're O
right O
, O

. O

I O
do O
need O
this O
leave O

out O

all O
the O

" O
No O

he O
eyed O
her O
strangely O

" O
I O

Like O
a O

Again O
her O
laughter O
trilled O

" O
She O
loosened O
the O
half-hoop B-CARDINAL
of O
diamonds O
on O
her O
left O
hand O
third B-ORDINAL
finger O
and O
held O
it O
out O

still O
playfully O

Without O
a O
glimmer O
of O
amusement O
in O
his O

, O
however O
, O
he O
took O
it O
, O
looking O
moodily O
beyond O
her O

" O
Perhaps O
it O

wear O
it O

he O
told O
her O

Thus O
had O
they O
parted O
