The O

the O
MR. O
GAITSKELL B-PERSON
today B-TIME
delivered O
a O
full-blooded O
defence O
of O
the O
Polaris O
missile O
base O
. O

And O
by O
implication O
he O
supported O
the O
establishment O
of O
sites O
in O
Britain B-LOCATION
for O
the O
training O
of O
German B-NORP
troops O
. O

His O
main O
theme O
was O
that O
nuclear O
weapons O
were O
necessary O
to O
defend O
Britain B-LOCATION
, O
that O
Britain B-LOCATION
must O
depend O
on O
Nato B-ORGANIZATION
and O
" O
the O
West B-LOCATION
" O
must O
have O
nuclear O
weapons O
so O
long O
as O
the O
Soviet B-LOCATION
Union I-LOCATION
has O
them O
. O

Addressing O
the O
annual O
congress O
of O
the O
National B-ORGANIZATION
Union I-ORGANIZATION
of I-ORGANIZATION
General I-ORGANIZATION
and I-ORGANIZATION
Municipal I-ORGANIZATION
Workers I-ORGANIZATION
, O
he O
said O
he O
felt O
sure O
the O
Labour B-ORGANIZATION
movement O
was O
coming O
round O
in O
support O
of O
his O
views O
. O

Obviously O
conscious O
of O
the O
fierce O
and O
widespread O
resentment O
over O
the O
U.S. B-LOCATION
Polaris O
base O
in O
Britain B-LOCATION
, O
Mr. O
Gaitskell B-PERSON
said O
that O
he O
even O
noticed O
that O
supporters O
of O
unilateral O
nuclear O
disarmament O
were O
changing O
their O
tactics O
by O
switching O
most O
of O
their O
emphasis O
on O
to O
the O
missile O
. O

Mr O
Gaitskell B-PERSON
said O
that O
a O
member O
of O
an O
alliance O
could O
not O
deny O
facilities O
to O
nations O
to O
which O
it O
was O
allied O
. O

But O
governments O
should O
be O
free O
to O
negotiate O
and O
refuse O
proposals O
with O
which O
they O
did O
not O
agree O
. O

The O
Labour B-ORGANIZATION
Party I-ORGANIZATION
opposed O
Thor O
missiles O
, O
because O
, O
he O
said O
, O
they O
were O
out O
of O
date O
and O
vulnerable O
and O
would O
attract O
enemy O
action O
. O

That O
argument O
did O
not O
apply O
to O
the O
Polaris O
submarine O
. O

So O
long O
as O
the O
Soviet B-LOCATION
Union I-LOCATION
had O
nuclear O
weapons O
, O
the O
West B-LOCATION
, O
somewhere O
, O
must O
have O
them O
too O
. O

It O
was O
far O
better O
for O
a O
weapon O
used O
for O
retaliatory O
purposes O
to O
be O
under O
the O
sea O
rather O
than O
on O
land O
. O

This O
was O
why O
the O
Labour B-ORGANIZATION
Party I-ORGANIZATION
did O
not O
think O
it O
right O
to O
oppose O
the O
Polaris O
depot O
ship O
. O

The O
party O
agreed O
that O
it O
was O
unwise O
to O
locate O
the O
base O
in O
the O
Holy B-LOCATION
Loch I-LOCATION
, O
only O
30 B-CARDINAL
miles O
from O
Glasgow B-LOCATION
, O
a O
city O
with O
two B-CARDINAL
million I-CARDINAL
people O
. O

It O
should O
be O
sited O
in O
a O
more O
remote O
area O
. O

Mr. O
Gaitskell B-PERSON
added O
that O
the O
Scarborough B-LOCATION
conference O
decisions O
did O
not O
, O
in O
his O
view O
, O
truly O
reflect O
the O
opinions O
of O
the O
majority O
of O
party O
members O
and O
still O
less O
the O
party's O
supporters O
in O
the O
country O
. O

Mr O
Gaitskell B-PERSON
added O
that O
agreement O
with O
the O
unilateralists O
was O
not O
possible O
, O
though O
he O
respected O
their O
views O
. O

He O
saw O
by O
reports O
that O
" O
those O
who O
organise O
these O
things O
" O
were O
recommending O
the O
supporters O
of O
unilateral O
nuclear O
disarmament O
to O
shift O
the O
emphasis O
of O
their O
intervention O
away O
from O
straight O
opposition O
to O
the O
official O
document O
on O
to O
opposition O
to O
the O
Polaris O
base O
. O

To O
Mr. O
Macmillan B-PERSON
, O
Mr O
Gaitskell B-PERSON
said O
the O
Prime O
Minister O
should O
begin O
to O
take O
seriously O
the O
danger O
of O
the O
spread O
of O
nuclear O
weapons O
within O
the O
Nato B-ORGANIZATION
alliance O
. O

" O
Let O
us O
say O
to O
Macmillan B-PERSON
that O
he O
should O
press O
, O
I O
hope O
with O
the O
agreement O
of O
Kennedy B-PERSON
, O
in O
talks O
with O
the O
Soviet B-LOCATION
Union I-LOCATION
, O
for O
the O
establishment O
in O
central O
Europe B-LOCATION
of O
a O
zone O
of O
controlled O
disarmament O
. O

" O
He O
thought O
, O
he O
said O
, O
that O
the O
Soviet B-LOCATION
Union I-LOCATION
would O
be O
prepared O
to O
reach O
an O
agreement O
on O
a O
zone O
of O
controlled O
disarmament O
in O
Europe B-LOCATION
. O

Mr O
Gaitskell B-PERSON
concluded O
, O
declaring O
that O
the O
present O
was O
the O
beginning O
of O
a O
great O
period O
of O
opportunity O
for O
the O
party O
. O

It O
was O
a O
great O
chance O
that O
should O
be O
grasped O
. O

Inter-union O
jealousies O
prevent O
the O
fulfilment O
of O
a O
common O
policy O
for O
wages O
and O
other O
major O
questions O
, O
Mr. O
Jack B-PERSON
Cooper I-PERSON
The O
General B-ORGANIZATION
Council I-ORGANIZATION
of I-ORGANIZATION
the I-ORGANIZATION
Trades I-ORGANIZATION
Union I-ORGANIZATION
Congress I-ORGANIZATION
should O
therefore O
consider O
the O
matter O
. O

Consideration O
should O
also O
be O
given O
to O
the O
regrouping O
of O
unions O
and O
the O
modification O
of O
their O
structures O
to O
meet O
the O
growing O
concentration O
of O
capital O
. O

Mr. O
Cooper B-PERSON
argued O
that O
a O
common O
industrial O
contribution O
was O
urgent O
- O
particularly O
in O
unions O
serving O
workers O
in O
the O
same O
industry O
- O
along O
Suggesting O
that O
a O
total O
T.U.C. B-ORGANIZATION
membership O
of O
eight B-CARDINAL
million I-CARDINAL
was O
a O
" O
poor O
show O
" O
compared O
with O
some O
countries O
, O
he O
argued O
that O
the O
position O
needed O
examination O
. O

BEFORE O
President O
Kennedy B-PERSON
met O
Mr. O
Macmillan B-PERSON
yesterday B-TIME
morning I-TIME
he O
was O
given O
the O
views O
of O
a O
wide O
section O
of O
the O
British B-NORP
people O
about O
Polaris O
submarine O
bases O
in O
this O
country O
. O

An O
open O
letter O
written O
by O
Earl O
Russell B-PERSON
hoping O
that O
the O
Earl O
Russell B-PERSON
, O
President O
of O
the O
Committee B-ORGANIZATION
of I-ORGANIZATION
100 I-ORGANIZATION
, O
told O
Kennedy B-PERSON
that O
he O
should O
take O
notice O
of O
" O
that O
very O
large O
and O
growing O
section O
which O
is O
opposed O
to O
the O
establishment O
of O
a O
Polaris O
base O
, O
whether O
at O
Holy B-LOCATION
Loch I-LOCATION
or O
elsewhere O
on O
British B-NORP
territory O
. O

" O
He O
pointed O
out O
that O
already O
there O
have O
been O
protests O
but O
that O
" O
very O
much O
larger O
protests O
are O
to O
be O
expected O
and O
are O
being O
planned O
. O

" O
There O
are O
three B-CARDINAL
kinds O
of O
reasons O
that O
justify O
the O
protests O
and O
these O
should O
carry O
weight O
with O
the O
U.S. B-ORGANIZATION
Government I-ORGANIZATION
, O
Earl O
Russell B-PERSON
suggested O
. O

" O
The O
first B-CARDINAL
of O
these O
reasons O
is O
the O
importance O
of O
pre- O
serving O
the O
hitherto O
cordial O
relations O
between O
the O
U.S. B-LOCATION
and O
Great B-LOCATION
Britain I-LOCATION
, O
not O
only O
in O
Government B-ORGANIZATION
circles O
, O
but O
in O
public O
opinion O
. O

" O
Earl O
Russell B-PERSON
says O
it O
is O
inevitable O
, O
though O
profoundly O
regrettable O
, O
that O
the O
agitation O
against O
the O
Polaris O
base O
has O
generated O
some O
antagonism O
to O
the O
policy O
of O
the O
United B-LOCATION
States I-LOCATION
. O

The O
second B-CARDINAL
reason O
is O
concerned O
with O
doubts O
as O
to O
the O
safety O
of O
the O
people O
of O
Great B-LOCATION
Britain I-LOCATION
; O
" O
in O
the O
time O
of O
crisis O
it O
would O
probably O
be O
impossible O
for O
the O
British B-NORP
authorities O
to O
exercise O
any O
degree O
of O
control O
over O
the O
action O
of O
Polaris O
submarines O
. O

" O
He O
argues O
that O
there O
is O
a O
distinct O
possibility O
that O
so O
long O
as O
there O
is O
a O
Polaris O
base O
in O
Britain B-LOCATION
the O
Soviet B-LOCATION
Union I-LOCATION
might O
retaliate O
against O
Britain B-LOCATION
alone O
. O

" O
Such O
retaliation O
might O
, O
and O
probably O
would O
, O
destroy O
the O
whole O
population O
of O
Britain B-LOCATION
in O
the O
course O
of O
, O
at O
the O
most O
, O
an B-TIME
hour I-TIME
" O
without O
provoking O
American B-NORP
retaliation O
. O

Earl O
Russell B-PERSON
believes O
: O
" O
It O
is O
very O
questionable O
whether O
British B-NORP
membership O
of O
Nato B-ORGANIZATION
and O
British B-NORP
permission O
of O
American B-NORP
bases O
on O
our O
territory O
add O
anything O
to O
the O
strength O
of O
America B-LOCATION
, O
while O
, O
on O
the O
contrary O
, O
they O
impose O
upon O
America B-LOCATION
an O
onerous O
obligation O
which O
it O
may O
prove O
impossible O
to O
fulfil O
. O

" O
The O
third B-CARDINAL
reason O
is O
that O
the O
supreme O
interest O
for O
the O
whole O
world O
- O
East B-LOCATION
and O
West B-LOCATION
and O
uncommitted O
nations O
- O
is O
the O
prevention O
of O
nuclear O
war O
. O

" O
A O
rapidly O
growing O
body O
of O
opinion O
in O
this O
country O
believes O
that O
Britain B-LOCATION
could O
be O
more O
effective O
in O
preventing O
a O
nuclear O
war O
as O
a O
neutral O
by O
helping O
to O
suggest O
agreements O
which O
could O
be O
accepted O
by O
both O
East B-LOCATION
and O
West B-LOCATION
. O

" O
Short O
of O
wearing O
the O
same O
uniform O
, O
which O
is O
not O
contemplated O
, O
the O
Navy B-ORGANIZATION
, O
Army B-ORGANIZATION
and O
Royal B-ORGANIZATION
Air I-ORGANIZATION
Force I-ORGANIZATION
would O
become O
, O
for O
practical O
purposes O
, O
a O
single O
defence O
force O
. O

There O
would O
be O
complete O
co-operation O
at O
all O
levels O
in O
training O
and O
operations O
. O

This O
would O
apply O
also O
in O

" O

It O

false O

the O
absence O

no O

West B-LOCATION
Germany I-LOCATION

Even O

- O
One O

wonder O

disposal O
of O
those O

who O
razed O
Coventry B-LOCATION

WEST B-LOCATION
GERMANY I-LOCATION
- O
Russia B-LOCATION
would O
like O
to O
see O
a O
clear O
 O
realization O
that O
West B-LOCATION
Germany I-LOCATION
would O
not O
survive O
even O
a B-TIME
few I-TIME
hours I-TIME
of O
a O
third B-CARDINAL
world O

. O

The O
best O
way O
to O
rule O
out O
such O
a O
tragic O
contingency O
would O
be O
to O
sign O
a O
peace O
treaty O
to O
remove O
the O
cancerous O
growth O
of O
West B-LOCATION
Berlin's I-LOCATION
occupation O
status O
. O

This O
figure O
has O
been O
surpassed O
only O
on O
the O
eve B-TIME
of O
the O
East B-NORP
German I-NORP
disturbances O
on O
July B-TIME
17 I-TIME
, I-TIME
1953 I-TIME
. O

And O
officials O
fear O
it O
may O
be O
too O
much O
for O
the O
city's O
refugee O
camps O
. O

They O
will O
overflow O
and O
private O
houses O
will O
have O
to O
be O
used O
. O

He O
holds O
that O
more O
pressure O
can O
be O
put O
on O
South B-LOCATION
Africa I-LOCATION
while O
she O
remains O
in O
the O
Commonwealth B-ORGANIZATION
than O
could O
be O
exercised O
were O
she O
cut O
off O
from O
it O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
those O
who O
favour O
expulsion O
, O
inclu- O
ding O
African B-NORP
leaders O
, O
feel O
that O
nothing O
less O
than O
the O
shock O
of O
expulsion O
will O
weaken O
the O
grip O
of O
Dr. O
Verwoerd B-PERSON
and O
the O
Nationalists B-NORP
. O

They O
point O
out O
that O
Dr. O
Verwoerd B-PERSON
refuses O
to O
consider O
abandoning O
the O
apartheid O
policy O
. O

THE O
Commonwealth B-ORGANIZATION
is O
a O
multi-racial O
society O
. O

A O
policy O
of O
racial O
discrimination O
in O
any O
of O
its O
countries O
is O
surely O
the O
one B-CARDINAL
thing O
that O
it O
could O
not O
survive O
. O

Whatever O
statesmen O
say O
at O
the O
conference O
table O
in O
London B-LOCATION
, O
millions B-CARDINAL
at O
home O
would O
regard O
as O
fraudulent O
a O
Commonwealth B-ORGANIZATION
which O
had O
room O
for O
a O
racist O
South B-LOCATION
Africa I-LOCATION
. O

And O
this O
is O
a O
Commonwealth B-ORGANIZATION
in O
which O
five B-CARDINAL
citizens O
are O
coloured O
for O
every O
one O
who O
is O
white O
. O

Seen O
in O
this O
wider O
picture O
, O
a O
South B-LOCATION
Africa I-LOCATION
that O
clings O
to O
apartheid O
is O
a O
menace O
to O
the O
Commonwealth B-ORGANIZATION
and O
a O
liability O
to O
the O
whole O
Western B-NORP
world O
. O

A O
practical O
solution O
would O
be O
for O
the O
Commonwealth B-ORGANIZATION
to O
draft O
a O
set O
of O
principles O
excluding O
race O
discrimination O
. O

And O
so O
leave O
South B-LOCATION
Africa I-LOCATION
to O
make O
the O
grade O
, O
or O
go O
out O

THE O
Queen O

the O
Duke O
of O
Edinburgh B-LOCATION
come O
home O
tonight B-TIME

tour O
in O
the O
East B-LOCATION

The O
duke's O
trigger-finger O

the O
ritual O
slaughter O
of O

have O
taken O
the O
headlines O
in O
this O
country O

Nevertheless O
, O
the O
tour O
has O
been O
an O
immense O
success O
. O

The O
Queen O
has O
won O
a O
triumph O

It O
would O
be O
pleasanter O
if O
such O
cruel O

feudal O
performances O
as O

But O
the O
Queen O
and O

their O
visit O

The O
warmth O
of O
their O
welcome O
in O

are O
happy O
memories O

WEST B-LOCATION
GERMANY I-LOCATION
- O
followed O
yesterday B-TIME
by O
the O
Dutch B-NORP
- O
has O
made O
the O
gesture O
of O
a O
good O
neighbour O
. O

She O
has O
put O
up O
the O
value O
of O
her O
money O
. O

Certainly O
, O
the O
rise O
is O
very O
small O
. O

But O
it O
is O
a O
step O
in O
the O
direction O
of O
live-and-let-live O
. O

Hopes O
will O
now O
grow O
brighter O
of O
further O
international O
co-operation O
, O
which O
is O
the O
only O
way O
to O
solve O
the O
payments O
difficulties O
that O
upset O
the O
Western B-NORP
world O
. O

Britain B-LOCATION
and O
the O
U.S. B-LOCATION
, O
which O
have O
problems O
with O
their O
balances O
, O
will O
gain O
some O
immediate O
help O
. O

What O
it O
means O
in O
practical O
terms O
is O
that O
our O
exports O
to O
Germany B-LOCATION
will O
now O
be O
a O
little O
cheaper O
for O
Germans B-NORP
to O
buy O
, O
while O
the O
goods O
which O
Germany B-LOCATION
exports O
will O
be O
made O
a O
little O
dearer O
. O

Booming O
Germany B-LOCATION
is O
deliberately O
encouraging O
more O
imports O
as O
a O
means O
to O
curb O
rising O
prices O
at O
home O
. O

She O
is O
also O
aware O
how O
 O
unpopular O
she O
has O
been O
growing O
by O
failing O
until O
now O
to O
co-operate O
as O
a O
creditor O
nation O
should O
. O

Germany B-LOCATION
exports O
much O
more O
than O
she O
imports O
. O

For O
upwards B-TIME
of I-TIME
five I-TIME
years I-TIME
the O
world's O
reserves O
of O
dollars O
have O
been O
drained O
into O
Germany B-LOCATION
. O

There O
they O
have O
stayed O
uselessly O
locked O
up O
because O
Germany B-LOCATION
has O
no O
tradition O
of O
trading O
abroad O
. O

In O
addition O
the O
strength O
of O
Germany's B-LOCATION
trading O
position O
has O
attracted O
speculators O
to O
hold O
marks O
rather O
than O
pounds O
or O
dollars O
, O
hoping O
for O
the O
mark O
to O
rise O
, O
as O
has O
now O
happened O
. O

WILL O
the O
new O
valuation O
be O
enough O
to O
correct O
Germany's B-LOCATION
massive O
trading O
surplus O
and O
choke O
off O
speculation O
against O
dollar O
and O
pound O
? O

That O
is O
doubtful O
. O

If O
however O
, O
in O
addition O
to O
her O
new O
good-neighbour O
gesture O
, O
Germany B-LOCATION
takes O
a O
really O
big O
share O
in O
giving O
aid O
to O
underdeveloped O
nations O
, O
the O
world O
outlook O
will O
be O
brighter O
. O

What O
gives O
rise O
to O
optimism O
is O
the O
sign O
that O
Germany B-LOCATION
and O
the O
other O
leading O
Western B-NORP
nations O
are O
at O
long O
last O
moving O
towards O
a O
solution O
of O
currency O
problems O
by O
co-operation O
. O

What O
seems O
certain O
is O
that O
those O
who O
advocate O
putting O
off O
any O
approach O
until O
Mr O
Krushchev B-PERSON
gives O
evidence O
of O
a O
change O
of O
heart O
( O
whatever O
that O
may O
mean O
) O
would O
have O
us O
run O
risks O
greater O
than O
the O
West B-LOCATION
ought O
to O
run O
- O
and O
greater O
than O
President O
Kennedy's B-PERSON
most O
influential O
advisers O
seem O
disposed O
to O
face O
. O

The O
real O
question O
is O
what O
we O
should O
put O
to O
the O
Soviet B-ORGANIZATION
Government I-ORGANIZATION
as O
a O
basis O
for O
talks O
: O
and O
On O
this O

what O

and O
what O

The O
Government's B-ORGANIZATION
pompous O
little O
statement O
on O
Northern B-LOCATION
Rhodesia I-LOCATION
does O
not O
say O
much O
, O
but O
it O
says O
what O
is O
necessary O
- O
that O
the O
Northern B-LOCATION
Rhodesia I-LOCATION
Constitution O
is O
open O
to O
revision O
. O

This O
is O
news O
, O
however O
much O
the O
Government B-ORGANIZATION
tries O
to O
disguise O
it O
by O
saying O
that O
the O
revision O
would O
be O
Formula O
One B-CARDINAL
, O
which O
appeared O
in O
February B-TIME
, O
appeared O
to O
make O
this O
likely O
; O
Formula O
Two B-CARDINAL
, O
which O
appeared O
in O
June B-TIME
, O
made O
it O
very O
unlikely O
; O
if O
Formula O
Three B-CARDINAL
restores O
the O
original O
principle O
, O
that O
is O
all O
that O
need O
be O
required O
of O
it O
. O

It O
is O
a O
pity O
that O
the O
Government B-ORGANIZATION
should O
ever O
have O
been O
led O
away O
from O
this O
principle O
. O

It O
is O
a O
great O
pity O
that O
the O
Government B-ORGANIZATION
should O
give O
the O
appearance O
of O
responding O
, O
not O
to O
Mr O
Kaunda's B-PERSON
reasonable O
representations O
, O
but O
to O
the O
violence O
which O
he O
tried O
to O
prevent O
. O

To O
be O
able O
to O
say O
" O
New B-LOCATION

We O

not O

that O

lead O

decisive O
ones O

To O
Germany's B-LOCATION
Western B-NORP

the O

been O
a O

out O

It O

Mean- O

in O

itself O
the O

they O

But O
discussion O

What O
the O

HOW O
the O

repent O
its O

in O

! O

Eighteen B-TIME
months I-TIME

this O

peaceful O

And O
as O
the O
British B-ORGANIZATION

stepped O
up O
the O

so O
the O
Africans B-NORP
stepped O
up O
their O

TODAY B-TIME
, O
in O

that O

No O

its O

if O

that O

For O
Mr. O

they O

also O
the O
technical O

of O
abstraction O
. O

Every O
unnecessary O
detail O
, O
all O
superfluous O
local O

must O
be O
eliminated O
. O

He O
does O
not O
want O
the O

rather O
he O

" O
The O

His O
earlier O
film O

equally O

here O
the O

moves O
out O

into O
an O
icy O
supernatural O
vacuum O
Following O
Bruce B-PERSON
Marshall's I-PERSON
original O
novel O
with O
considerable O
fidelity O
, O
the O
film O
tells O
the O
story O
of O
a O
little O
monk O
who O
prays O
that O
a O
disrepu- O
table O
night O
club O
near O
his O
church O
be O

One B-TIME

the O

suddenly O
transplanted O

North B-LOCATION

But O
Father O

troubles O
have O
only O
begun O

A O
summary O
of O
the O
story O
can O
give O
almost O
indication O
of O
the O
scope O
of O
Wicki's B-PERSON
artistry O
. O

He O
tells O
his O
story O
best O
in O
the O
faces O
of O
his O
crowds O
, O
recording O
every O
wrinkle O
and O
drop O
of O
sweat O
with O
brutal O
honesty O
, O
building O
up O
to O
a O
tremendous O
climax O
in O
the O
island O
orgy O

Here O
, O

guests O
arrive O
in O
ghost-like O
yachts O
, O
the O
wildly O
flapping O
white O
sails O
slashed O
by O
the O
glaring O
beacon O
of O
a O
lighthouse O
. O

When O
the O
final O
miracle O
does O
occur O
, O
it O
is O
accepted O
as O
a O
marvellous O
joke O
; O
no O
one O
has O
learned O
anything O
. O

Wicki B-PERSON
suddenly O
returns O
to O
the O
city O
for O
a O
final O
epilogue O
. O

In O
complete O
silence O
he O
shows O
the O
faces O
of O
people O
walking O
in O
the O
streets O
, O
smug O
, O
content O
, O
satisfied O
, O
and O
thoroughly O
frightening O
. O

Wicki B-PERSON
has O
succeeded O
in O
his O
second B-CARDINAL
film O
in O
recording O
his O
personal O
apocalypse O
of O
the O
last B-TIME
days I-TIME
of O
a O
sick O
society O
. O

It O
is O
most O
unfair O
to O
call O
" O
Malachias B-PERSON
" O
a O
cut-rate O
" O
Dolce O

, O
" O
for O
it O
is O
far O
more O
intimate O

deeply O

paraphrase O

I O

more O

" O
last B-TIME
night I-TIME
as O
a O

in O
a O

" O
A O
polished O
production O
by O
Quentin B-PERSON

, O
here O
, O
held O
together O
by O
Mr. O
Houston's B-PERSON
accomplished O
performance O
as O
the O
master O
mind O
behind O
a O
gang O
of O
crooks O
. O

This O
plot O
to O
rob O
a O
French B-NORP
millionaire O
of O
300,000 B-CARDINAL
worth O
of O
jewellery O
struck O
me O
as O
ingenious O
. O

The O
play O
had O
style O
, O
moved O
at O
a O
quick O
pace O
and O
everyone O
did O
well O
. O

But O
it O
was O
Mr. O
Houston's B-PERSON
evening B-TIME
. O

Earlier O
, O
on O
the O
Palladium B-LOCATION
show O
I O
found O
Stanley B-PERSON
Holloway's I-PERSON
act O
too O
long O
and O
not O
particularly O
entertaining O
. O

It O
was O
also O
a O
mistake O
to O
re-book O
Gene B-PERSON
Detroy I-PERSON
and O
his O
performing O
chimpanzees O
so O
soon O
after O
their O
previous O
appearance O
. O

Their O
offering O
last B-TIME
night I-TIME
differed O
little O
from O
their O
earlier O
act O
on O
this O
show O
a B-TIME
week I-TIME
or I-TIME
so I-TIME
ago I-TIME
. O

But O
the O
Mudlarks O
, O
with O
Jeff B-PERSON
Mudd I-PERSON
out O
of O
the O
Army B-ORGANIZATION
and O
back O
with O
sister O
Mary B-PERSON
and O
brother O
Fred B-PERSON
, O
were O
in O
bright O
, O
zestful O
form O
. O

Why O
only O
two B-CARDINAL
numbers O
, O
though O
? O

It O
was O
not O
enough O
. O

" O
A O
FAIR O
COP O
, O
" O
the O
B B C B-ORGANIZATION
Whitehall B-LOCATION
farce O
last B-TIME
night I-TIME
, O
looked O
like O
a O
rabbit O

in O
a O
field O
of O
corn O
. O

I O
can't O
recall O
a O
production O
where O
so O
many O
comics O
bolted O
in O
and O
out O
of O
holes O
so O
often O
. O

The O
jokes O
were O
a O
reshuffle O
of O
the O
same O
old O
lot O
- O
this O
time O
Brian B-PERSON
Rix I-PERSON
lost O
his O
skirt O
instead O
of O
his O
trousers O
. O

The O
action O
moved O
at O
tremendous O
speed O
, O
backed O
by O
some O
wonderful O
timing O
by O
the O
cast O
. O

I O
especially O
liked O
the O
tea-cup O
scene O
where O
six B-CARDINAL
of O
the O
cast O
changed O
cups O
with O
the O
dexterity O
of O
Chinese B-NORP
jugglers O
. O

Carole B-PERSON
Shelley I-PERSON
as O
the O
newly-wed O
and O
Larry B-PERSON
Noble I-PERSON
as O
Smiler B-PERSON
Perkins I-PERSON
were O
the O
most O
laughable O
. O

They O
alone O
used O
a O
sharp O
edge O
to O
their O
humour O
and O
cut O
through O
the O
gormless O
standing O
corn O
around O
them O
. O

Perhaps O
it O
was O
accidental O
- O
I O
hope O
not O
. O

If O
ever O
a O
bag O
of O
humour O
needed O
a O
thorough O
shaking O
up O

The O

In O

the O

The O
omission O

a O
matter O
of O
editorial O
decision O
rather O
The O
edge O
of O
this O
sheet O

attached O
to O
a O

The O

the O

ample O
evidence O
of O
this O

and O
it O

It O
had O
two B-CARDINAL
disadvantages O

It O
was O
generally O
a O
single-sided O
form O

and O
it O
was O
not O
an O
easy O
form O
of O
book O

The O
Hebrew O
word O
" O
SHAMIR O
" O
means O
guarded O
or O
preser- O

Therefore O
, O
the O
real O
man O
, O
who O
regards O
himself O
as O
insignificant O
, O
as O
the O
prayer O
says O
: O
" O

A O

This O
man O
is O
the O
worm O
, O
the O
creature O
that O
cuts O

Such O
a O
man O
is O
the O
Shamir O
that O
guards O
him- O

against O
all O

Such O
a O
Shamir O
possesses O
the O
real O
acid O
to O
mould O
our O
character O
, O
to O
melt O
our O
heart O

This O
Shamir O
helps O
us O
earthly O
creatures O

an O

come O
nearer O
to O
God O

The O

of O
the O
Shamir O

books O

their O
books O

This O
Shamir O
is O
indeed O
a O
rare O
diamond O
that O
incises O
the O

the O
hardest O

And O
these O

It O
is O

And O
it O

The O

, O
the O

We O
have O
all O
come O
across O
human O
Shamirs O
and O
they O
leave O
a O
deep O
impression O
on O
our O
feelings O
and O
senses O
. O

They O
make O
us O
the O
Altar O
for O
God O
to O
emit O
the O
Light O
which O
can O
be O
read O
in O
every O
language O

The O
Shamir O
is O
the O
" O
seventh B-CARDINAL
" O
and O
most O
important O
creature O
, O
that O
was O
created O
on O
the O
eve B-TIME
of O
the O
Sabbath B-TIME
, O
to O
bring O
the O
Sabbath B-TIME
, O
real O
peace O
to O
the O
whole O

Then O
the O
whole O
earth O
will O
be O
His O
Altar O

" O
And O
it O
shall O
come O
to O
pass O
, O
if O
1ye O
shall O
1hearken O
diligently O
unto O
my O
commandments O
, O
which O
I O
command O
you O
this O
day O
, O
to O
love O
the O
Lord O
your O
God O
, O
and O
to O
serve O
Him O
with O
all O
your O
heart O
and O
with O
all O
your O
soul O
. O

" O
This O
may O
seem O
very O
good O
, O
but O
there O
is O
something O
deficient O
. O

Under O
such O
conditions O
without O
putting O
your O
mind O
together O
we O
cannot O
solve O
the O
further O
summons O
of O
destiny O

to O
solve O
the O
economic O
problems O

Hence O
says O
Rabbi O
Simeon B-PERSON
ben I-PERSON
Jochai I-PERSON
( O
Tanis B-LOCATION

) O
" O
if O
Israel B-LOCATION

Lord O

the O
work O

done O
by O

They O
will O
not O

If O
physical O
power O

spiritual O
power O
and O
visionary O
power O
is O
not O
united O
, O
man O
will O
remain O
in O
his O
heart O
selfish O
and O
think O
only O
of O
one's O
personal O
advantage O
to O
gratify O
selfish O
aims O
, O
then O
each O
man O
will O

instead O
of O
all O
to O
help O
to O
gather O
your O
corn O

your O

Freedom O

Of O

the O

: O
" O
Take O

the O

we O

The O

is O
called O
" O
the O
going-out O

. O

It O
starts O
with O
the O
story O
of O
the O
fringes O
the O
" O
tsitsits B-NORP
" O
. O

This O
lesson O
used O
to O
be O
read O
only O
in O
the O
morning B-TIME
. O

And O
the O
Talmud O
tells O
a O
story O
, O
which O
is O
also O
in O
the O
Hagadah O
that O
Rabbi O
Eleasar B-PERSON
ben I-PERSON
Assarja I-PERSON
said O
, O
" O
I O
am O
nearly B-TIME
seventy I-TIME
and O
I O
had O
not O
succeeded O
that O
And O
the O
tsitsits B-NORP
had O
a O
message O
sealed O
inside O
the O
knots O
just O
as O
there O
is O
a O
message O
sealed O
in O
the O
four B-CARDINAL
emblems O
which O
are O
used O
on O
Passover O
, O
to O
depict O
the O
" O
time O
of O
our O
freedom O

And O
they O

are O

our O

should O

Bitter O

the O
bitterness O

against O
us O

We O
eat O
it O

We O
accept O
it O
, O
to O
show O
we O
have O
self-control O
and O
that O
God O
dwells O
within O
us O
. O

And O
we O
answer O
, O
that O
the O
Lord O
our O
God O
gave O
us O
" O
four B-CARDINAL
freedoms O
" O
without O
which O
Society O
cannot O
make O
progress O
. O

And O
we O
drink O
" O
four B-CARDINAL
cups O
" O
to O
thank O
the O
Lord O
our O
God O
for O
the O
" O
four B-CARDINAL
freedoms O

are O
Divine O

There O
are O
four B-CARDINAL
ways O
of O
redemption O

( O

I O
will O
redeem O
you O

( O

I O
will O
take O
you O
to O
me O
for O
a O
people O

( O
1 B-CARDINAL
) O
I O
will O
bring O
you O
out O
from O
under O
the O
burdens O
of O
Egypt B-LOCATION
: O
How O
was O
it O
that O
Israel B-LOCATION
was O
brought O
out O
from O
under O
the O
burdens O
of O
Egypt B-LOCATION
? O

Because O
, O
they O
kept O
the O
Passover O
and O
they O
were O
eating O
Matzos O
in O
Egypt B-LOCATION
and O
the O
" O
Feast O
of O
Matzos O
" O
was O
known O
even O
to O
Abraham B-PERSON
and O
Lot B-PERSON
. O

They O
objected O
to O
the O
word O
Absolution O
. O

So O
the O
phrase O
' O
or O
the O
remission O
of O
sins O
' O
was O
added O
. O

But O
Absolution O
remained O
. O

They O
objected O
to O
the O
word O
Confirmation O
. O

So O
the O
phrase O
' O
or O
the O
laying O
on O
of O
hands O
upon O
children O
baptized O
and O
able O
to O
render O
an O
account O
of O
their O
faith O
according O
to O
the O
Catechism O
following O
' O
were O
added O
. O

But O
Confirmation O
remained O
. O

Other O
changes O
in O
the O
Book O
were O
equally O
minor O
except O
for O
the O
new O
section O
on O
the O
Sacraments O
added O
to O
the O
Catechism O

Or O
when O
he O
found O

going O

? O

Laud B-PERSON
made O
a O
positive O
approach O
. O

He O
set O
out O
to O
increase O
a O
sense O
of O
reverence O
. O

The O
Prayer O
Book O
was O
to O
be O
respected O
and O
so O
was O
the O
office O
of O
a O
bishop O

Altars O
should O
be O
altars O

not O

most O

Lucky O
indeed O
are O
the O
families O
that O

heritage O

a O
lace-trimmed O
Christening O
robe O
that O
each O
generation O
wears O
in O
turn O
- O
these O
are O
proud O
possessions O
, O
linked O
to O
the O
exquisite O
lace-making O
of O
the O
past O
. O

But O
lace-making O
is O
by O
no O
means O
a O
lost O
art O
. O

It O
suffered O
a O
decline O
and O
fell O
into O
lamentably O
low O
standards O
in O
the O
fussy O
over-furnishing O
of O
the O
Victorian B-TIME

it O
would O
take O
more O
than O

Coats B-ORGANIZATION
Mercer-Crochet O
possesses O
qualities O
which O
are O
of O
the O
utmost O
importance O
to O
the O
worker O
. O

It O
washes O
beautifully O
, O
never O
loses O
its O
colour O
nor O
becomes O
' O
stringy O
' O
, O
is O
very O
elastic O
and O
preserves O
the O
beauty O
of O
the O
design O
. O

It O
is O
easy O
to O
work O
with O
, O
soft O
, O
glossy O
and O
of O
uniform O
thickness O
- O
it O
is O
the O
ideal O
crochet O
thread O
. O

Remember O
that O
texture O
plays O
an O
important O
part O
in O
the O
beauty O
of O
crochet O
. O

The O
finer O
mercerised O
threads O
are O
more O
effective O
for O
the O
delicate O
designs O
used O
for O
tablecloths O
, O
doilies O
, O
edgings O
and O
accessories O
, O
while O
the O
heavier O
threads O
are O
used O
for O
bedspreads O
, O
chairbacks O
, O
luncheon O
mats O
, O
etc. O
Crochet O

Incidentally O
, O
it O
is O
better O
to O
complete O
any O

that O
may O
be O
needed O
at O
the O

This O
last O
point O
is O
certainly O
important O
because O
almost O
everyone O
has O
come O
to O
recognise O
that O
machines O
are O
not O
only O
an O
economic O
necessity O
, O
but O
that O
a O
great O
deal O
of O
drudgery O
can O
be O
avoided O
by O
the O
installation O
of O
a O
power O
tool O
. O

As O
an O
elementary O
example O
, O
surely O
no O
one O
can O
pretend O
to O
enjoy O
ripping O
out O
parts O
from O
hardwood O
. O

Most O
men O
would O
unhesitatingly O
use O
a O
machine O
if O
it O
were O
available O
. O

Coming O
now O
to O
the O
actual O
tools O
and O
their O
cost O
, O
we O
begin O
with O
what O
we O
have O
called O
a O
bare O
minimum O
kit O
. O

Probably O
most O
men O
have O
some O
of O
the O
tools O
already O
. O

It O
will O
enable O
a O
man O
to O
make O
simple O
, O
straight-forward O
things O
, O
and O
in O
any O
case O
may O
be O
regarded O
as O
a O
good O
beginning O
to O
which O
other O
tools O
can O
be O
added O
as O
the O
need O
arises O
. O

The O
nature O
of O
the O
work O
will O
probably O
dictate O
the O
additions O
to O
be O
made O
, O
but O
as O
a O
guide O
we O
have O
given O
a O
fuller O
kit O
which O
increases O
the O
range O
of O
things O
that O
can O
be O
made O
enormously O
. O

Lastly O
, O
we O
suggest O
certain O
power O
tools O
and O
machines O
, O
the O
choice O
of O
which O
will O
depend O
partly O
upon O
the O
space O
available O
in O
the O
workshop O
, O
the O
amount O
one O
is O
prepared O
to O
pay O
, O
and O
the O
type O
of O
work O
a O
man O
normally O
does O
. O

First B-CARDINAL
, O
however O
, O
a O
word O
of O
advice O
generally O
. O

Do O
not O
buy O
so-called O
cheap O
tools O
or O
machines O
. O

They O
never O
are O
cheap O
in O
the O
long O
run O
. O

They O
may O
be O
inaccurate O
, O
Most O
tools O
have O
to O
lead O
an O
intensive O
life O
, O
and O
faults O
in O
design O
or O
quality O
soon O
become O
apparent O
. O

It O
is O
far O
better O
to O
pay O
the O
fair O
price O
for O
a O
tool O
of O
good O
quality O
, O
and O
not O
handicap O
yourself O
from O
the O
start O
. O

To O
put O
it O
in O
a O
slightly O
different O
way O
, O
do O
not O
allow O
yourself O
to O
blame O
the O
tools O
when O
the O
job O
does O
not O
turn O
out O
quite O
right O
! O

timber O
. O

Punch O
in O
all O
nail O
and O
panel O
pin O
heads O
and O
fill O
the O
holes O
with O
plastic O
wood O
. O

Then O
thoroughly O
glasspaper O
the O
whole O
framework O
and O
round O
off O
any O
sharp O
edges O
( O
such O
as O
the O
edge O
of O
the O
seat O
, O
feeding O
tray O
, O
etc O
) O
. O

Fill O
the O
grain O
with O
a O
woodfiller O
in O
the O
usual O
way O
and O
paint O
the O
frame O
in O
a O
suitable O
pastel O
shade O
, O
using O
a O
contrasting O
colour O
for O
the O
seat O
and O
the O
back O
which O
can O
be O
decorated O
with O
a O
suitable O
nursery O
transfer O
. O

Avoid O
using O
lead-based O
paint O
as O
this O
could O
prove O
poisonous O
if O
junior O
decides O
to O
bite O
the O
chair O
. O

Finally O
, O
it O
is O
as O
well O
to O
cover O
the O
footrest O
with O
rubber O
or O
any O
such O
protective O
material O
that O
might O
be O
available O
as O
otherwise O
the O

be O
scratched O
off O

BUILDING O
your O
own O

is O
a O
most O
satisfying O
and O
worthwhile O
project O

This O
is O
hot O

ensure O
a O

This O

The O

made O
of O
any O
sound O
five-ply B-CARDINAL
wood O
of O
the O
same O
make O
, O
or O
oak O
or O
mahogany O
. O

For O
the O
last O
one O
I O
made O
, O
I O
used O
the O
two B-CARDINAL
flaps O
from O
an O
old O
mahogany O
table O
which O
I O
bought O
at O
a O
sale O
for O
one B-CARDINAL
shilling O
. O

I O
have O
also O
included O
a O
sketch O
of O
paddles O
I O
make O
for O
rowing O
this O
dinghy O
( O
Fig. O
3 B-CARDINAL
) O
. O

They O
are O
very O
simple O
, O
cheap O
and O
easy O
to O
make O
. O

As O
will O
be O
seen O
from O
the O
plan O
there O
is O
only O
a O
single O
gunwale O
on O
the O
outside O
. O

I O
find O
that O
the O
type O
of O
rowlock O
we O
use O
in O
Canada B-LOCATION
is O
difficult O
to O
obtain O
here O
and O
expensive O
. O

I O
overcome O
this O
in O
another O
way O
as O
shown O
in O
Fig. O
4 B-CARDINAL
. O

Cut O
the O
moulds O
and O
the O
transoms O
to O
shape O
as O
in O
the O
detailed O
drawings O
. O

If O
you O
have O
a O
wooden O
floor O
you O
can O
use O
' O
A O
' O
frames O
fastened O
to O
the O
floor O
if O
not O
, O
use O
a O
strong O
horizontal O
frame O
that O
will O
sit O
firmly O
on O
the O
ground O
or O
concrete O
floor O
. O

I O
use O
a O
heavy O
old O
base O
as O
in O
Fig. O
2 B-CARDINAL
. O

The O
edges O
of O
the O
transoms O
should O
be O
bevelled O
to O
correspond O
to O
the O
sides O
and O
bottom O
of O
the O
boat O
. O

Don't O
forget O
to O
cut O
out O
on O
each O
side O
of O
each O
mould O
to O
allow O
for O
the O
chines O
to O
rest O
in O
these O
notches O
, O
as O
they O
are O
not O
fastened O
to O
the O
moulds O
, O
which O
will O
only O
be O
used O
whilst O
the O
hull O
is O
under O
construction O
. O

Again O
, O
don't O
forget O
to O
glue O
. O

Now O
put O
on O
the O
keel O
and O
the O
rubbing O
strakes O
and O
you O
are O
ready O
to O
lift O
the O
boat O
off O
the O
moulds O
. O

You O
won't O
want O
them O
again O
for O
this O
boat O
, O
so O
shift O
them O
right O
out O
of O
the O
way O
. O

Place O
the O
boat O
right O
side O
up O
on O
two B-CARDINAL
boxes O
or O
trestles O
of O
convenient O
height O
for O
working O
. O

Fix O
on O
the O
gunwales O
and O
insert O
the O
thwarts O
( O
seats O
) O
taking O
care O
to O
reinforce O
the O
sides O
of O
the O
dinghy O
at O
the O
seats O
with O
vertical O
members O
as O
shown O
in O
the O
plans O
. O

Make O
the O
four B-CARDINAL
blocks O
for O
the O
rowlocks O
and O
mark O
their O
positions O
before O
riveting O
on O
the O
gunwales O
so O
that O
you O
do O
not O
put O
a O
rivet O
where O
you O
will O
have O
to O
cut O
out O
the O
inside O
( O
gunwale O
) O
one O
to O
fit O
the O
block O
. O

I O
rivet O
my O
gunwales O
together O
through O
the O
side O
of O
the O
hull O
with O
copper O
nails O
and O
roves O
. O

It O
greatly O
improves O
the O
appearance O
and O
the O
strength O
. O

Paint O

good O
marine O
primer O
, O
undercoat O
and O
at B-CARDINAL
least I-CARDINAL
one I-CARDINAL

Soil O
blocks O
are O
probably O
the O
oldest O
alternative O
to O
clay O
pots O
for O
plant O
raising O
. O

These O
are O
compressed O
blocks O
of O
compost O
, O
made O
in O
a O
specially O
devised O
press O
to O
simulate O
roughly O
the O
shape O
and O
size O
of O
a O
pot O
. O

Usually O
cylindrical O
or O
hexagonal O
in O
shape O
, O
they O
are O
made O
of O
the O
same O
compost O
as O
would O
have O
been O
used O
in O
a O
pot O
, O
the O
 O
only O
difference O
being O
that O
it O
is O
used O
in O
a O
slightly O
moister O
condition O
. O

Seed O
is O
sown O
, O
or O
seedlings O
are O
pricked O
out O
into O
them O
in O
the O
normal O
way O
, O
the O
only O
real O
difference O
being O
that O
more O
of O
the O
watering O
is O
done O
through O
a O
rose O
to O
avoid O
breaking O
the O
blocks O
with O
a O

First-class B-CARDINAL
plants O
of O
tomatoes O
, O
cucumbers O
, O
marrows O
, O
melons O
, O
cauliflowers O
, O
celery O
and O
onions O
, O
may O
all O
be O
raised O
in O
soil O
blocks O
; O
so O
can O
such O
flowering O
plants O
as O
dahlias O
, O
chrysanthemums O
, O
salvias O
, O
sweet O
peas O
, O
lupins O
and O
numerous O
others O
. O

One B-CARDINAL
big O
advantage O
of O
soil O
blocks O
is O
an O
obvious O
one O
: O
the O
cost O
of O
a O
pot O
of O
any O
description O
is O
saved O
completely O
. O

Manufacturing O
the O
block O
and O
planting O
it O
is O
very O
little O
more O
trouble O
than O
normal O
potting O
, O
and O
a O
superior O
plant O
, O
which O
transplants O
more O
easily O
, O
is O
produced O
. O

The O
obvious O
limitation O
 O
is O
that O
soil O
blocks O
can O
only O
be O
used O
for O
propagating O
; O
there O
can O
be O
no O
progression O
to O
a O
larger O
block O
when O
the O
plant O
or O
seedling O
is O
ready O
to O
be O
moved O
; O
it O
must O
be O
planted O
out O
or O
potted O
. O

Many O
amateur O
gardeners O
might O
improve O
their O
results O
by O
buying O
a O
small O
hand-operated O
soil O
block O
maker O
and O
use O
the O
money O
saved O
on O
buying O
small O
pots O
to O
improve O
their O
composts O
. O

The O
various O
types O
of O
small O
paper O
pots O
are O
very O
useful O
for O
short-term O
operations O
, O
but O
are O
inclined O
to O
collapse O
if O
the O
plants O
are O
in O
them O
too O
long O
. O

They O
are O
 O
quite O
useful O
for O
plants O
that O
are O
despatched O
to O
market O
or O
direct O
to O
customers O
, O
their O
cheapness O
making O
them O
attractive O
to O
the O
nurseryman O
; O
there O
is O
also O
considerable O
saving O
in O
carriage O
costs O
because O
of O
their O
lightness O
. O

There O
are O
many O
types O
of O
plastic O
pots O
available O
; O
some O
expensive O
, O
some O
quite O
cheap O
; O
some O
good O
and O
others O
not O
so O
good O
. O

A O
wide O
range O
of O
plants O
grow O
quite O
well O
in O
plastic O
pots O
and O
usually O
need O
less O
water O
than O
those O
in O
clay O
pots O
. O

They O
are O
slightly O
more O

a O

Plastic O
pots O
are O
usually O
more O
expensive O
than O
clay O
ones O
, O
but O
they O
are O
almost O
indestructible O
and O
will O
last O
a O
long O
time O
with O
normal O
care O
. O

We O
must O
beware O
, O
however O
, O
of O
supposing O
that O
there O
must O
be O
any O
close O
analogy O
between O
the O
units O
of O
quite O
different O
sciences O
. O

For O
example O
the O
success O
of O
the O
atomic O
theory O
in O
physics O
might O
lead O
us O
to O
suppose O
that O
the O
ultimate O
units O
of O
geometry O
must O
be O
points O
. O

It O
would O
be O
more O
correct O
to O
regard O
operations O
as O
the O
ultimate O
units O
of O
geometry O
. O

There O
have O
been O
many O
conflicting O
tendencies O
in O
psychology O
in O
its O
search O
for O
ultimate O
units O
and O
here O
we O
can O
only O
indicate O
what O
seems O
to O
be O
the O
most O
promising O
concept O
which O
is O
current O
today B-TIME
. O

It O
is O
known O
as O
the O
schema O
. O

It O
is O
not O
an O
easy O
concept O
and O
if O
I O
try O
to O
make O
it O
concrete O
it O
will O
be O
at O
the O
cost O
of O
over-simplification O
but O
even O
so O
it O
may O
be O
better O
than O
a O
meaningless O
abstraction O
. O

This O
is O
what O
I O
mean O
by O
" O
getting O
things O
the O
wrong O
way O
round O
" O
. O

He O
is O
far O
more O
likely O
to O
find O
out O
about O
how O
his O
own O
mind O
works O
by O
looking O
at O
other O
people's O
. O

For O
although O
looking O
inwards O
( O
or O
" O
introspecting O
" O
as O
it O
is O
called O
) O
, O
is O
not O
entirely O
ruled O
out O
, O
nowadays O
most O
psychologists O
would O
agree O
that O
it O
is O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
the O
most O
unreliable O
methods O
of O
getting O
any O
precise O
information O
. O

She O
had O
been O
struck O
several O
times O
with O
a O
blunt O
instrument O
, O
and O
her O
head O
was O
smashed O
in O
. O

There O
were O
signs O
of O
a O
violent O
struggle O
, O
blood O
on O
the O
cushions O
and O
floor O
, O
and O
the O
remains O
of O
her O
broken O
umbrella O
. O

But O
a O
pair O
of O
bone O
cuff-links O
found O
in O
the O
compartment O
seemed O
to O
provide O
the O
only O
possible O
clue O

the O

It O
is O
not O
our O
purpose O
to O
discuss O
this O
dictum O
. O

Suffice O
to O
say O
that O
few O
of O
us O
stop O
to O
marvel O
at O
the O
progress O
of O
civilisation O
which O
allows O
a O
dish O
borrowed O
straight O
from O
the O
prehistoric O
. O

How O
many O
centuries O
ago O
, O
in O
some O
cave O
or O
hilly O
hide O
, O
did O
our O
forebears O
home O
from O
the O
chase O
hold O
forth O
from O
a O
spear O
the O
welcome O
gobbet O
of O
meat O
or O
fish O
burnt O
and O
roasted O
in O
the O
homely O
and O
protecting O
flame O
. O

How O
many O
centuries O
later O
did O
the O
mercenary O
in O
the O
Roman B-NORP
wars O
thus O
impale O
on O
pike O
or O
lance O
his O
evening O
meal O
. O

Later O
came O
the O
thrifty O
peasant O
, O
later O
still O
the O
young O
Victorian B-NORP
buck O
adventuring O
in O
Paris B-LOCATION
, O
and O
even O
later O
our O
attractive O
young O
ladies O
toying O
with O
these O
primitive O
morsels O
in O
the O
gleam O
and O
glitter O
of O
our O
latter-day O
restaurants O
. O

And O
, O
if O
certain O
dishes O
and O
modes O
of O
food O
have O
persisted O
down O
the O
ages O
, O
the O
motive O
that O
preserved O
them O
has O
always O
been O
the O
same O
. O

Apart O
from O
the O
need O
for O
nourishment O
, O
the O
instinct O
of O
hospitality O
has O
always O
been O
strong O
in O
mankind O
. O

The O
sharing O
of O
a O
meal O
in O
those O
earliest O
dangerous O
days O
was O
an O
admittance O
into O
an O
acquaintanceship O
far O
more O
important O
than O
the O
casual O
meetings O
of O
the B-TIME
present I-TIME
day I-TIME
; O
the O
desire O
to O
share O
something O
more O
intimate O
than O
mere O
converse O
has O
always O
been O
there O
. O

The O
truth O
is O
that O
good O
food O
offers O
a O
programme O
of O
entertainment O
almost O
unlimited O
in O
its O
variety O
and O
its O
presen- O
tation O
affords O
an O
opportunity O
of O
showing O
a O
guest O
something O
of O
ourselves O
. O

It O
is O
a O
far O
enough O
cry O
from O
the O
primitive O
meal-times O
of O
a O
simpler O
world O
to O
the O
banquets O
of O
later O
days O
, O
when O
the O
table O
groaned O
under O
its O
load O
of O
complicated O
dishes O
, O
and O
for O
all O
the O
blossoming O
of O
the O
arts O
around O
them O
the O

were O
little O

was O
always O

that O
, O
if O

It O
seems O
obvious O
that O
if O
an O

Brittany B-LOCATION
was O
compelled O
to O
attack O
via O
Calais B-LOCATION

then O
the O
primary O

of O
the O
French B-NORP
war O
was O
a O
navy O
in O
unquestioned O

It O
seems O
obvious O
that O
divided O
forces O
were O
dissipating O
the O
advantages O
of O
a O

included O

In O
this O
cruel O
process O
which O
was O
hammering O
out O
nations O

the O

there O
was O
a O
constant O
stirring O
of O
those O
in O

find O
some O
simple O
way O
out O
of O
the O

6impasse O
which O
always O
resulted O

in O
the O

of O
the O

the O
story O
of O
the O

In O
appreciating O
this O
story O
, O
modern O
con- O
ceptions O
of O
governmental O
duties O
must O
be O
set O
aside O
. O

A O
modern O
government O
needs O
taxation O
not O
merely O
for O
defence O
and O
offence O
but O
for O
a O
very O
wide O
range O
of O
social O
services O
. O

A O
mediaeval O
oligarchy O
needed O
taxation O
in O
order O
to O
supplement O
the O
private O
wealth O
of O
the O
monarchy O
( O
the O
royal O
income O
from O
the O
revenues O
of O
crown O
lands O
, O
the O
fees O
of O
feudalism O
Social O
service O
as O
a O
function O
of O
government O
was O
quite O
alien O
to O
mediaeval O
thought O
- O
its O
substitute O
was O
the O
mutual O
self-help O
of O
communities O
, O
whether O
those O
communities O
were O
monasteries O
, O
manors O
, O
townships O
, O
or O
wards O
and O
guilds O
of O
a O
city O
. O

A O
mediaeval O
tax O
was O
therefore O
in O
essence O
a O
forced O
payment O
whose O
return O
was O
the O
uncertain O
bounty O
of O
booty O
and O
the O
vague O
advantages O
of O
military O
glory O
; O
it O
was O
therefore O
always O
granted O
grudgingly O
and O
coupled O
with O
the O
vain O
hope O
that O
, O
in O
the O
When O

his O
' O
war O
did O
not O
bring O
victory O
and O
booty O
, O
a O
new O
group O

might O
oust O
the O
unsuccessful O

the O
Commons B-ORGANIZATION
, O
who O
usually O

bold O
enough O

But O
the O

not O

even O
a O

not O

these O

During O
the B-TIME
four- I-TIME
teenth I-TIME
century I-TIME
, O
the O
traditional O
methods O
of O
financing O
the O
Exchequer O
had O
become O
stabilized O
. O

When O
the O
King O
and O
his O
Council B-ORGANIZATION
required O
additio- O
nal O
funds O
, O
they O
were O
usually O
granted O
an O
export O
tax O
on O
the O
wool O
trade O
, O
collected O
by O
means O
of O
that O
' O
staple O
' O
system O
which O
ensured O
that O
prices O
, O
quality O
and O
tax O
could O
be O
efficiently O
su- O
pervised O
and O
controlled O
, O
together O
with O
a O
There O
were O
two B-CARDINAL
other O
sources O
of O
public O
revenue O
- O
first B-CARDINAL
, O
the O
Church B-ORGANIZATION
, O
which O
wisely O
followed O
the O
lead O
of O
the O
Commons B-ORGANIZATION
and O
in O
its O
own O
Convocations O
granted O
equivalent O
contributions O
, O
and O
second B-CARDINAL
, O
the O
foreign O
merchants O
, O
with O
whom O
the O
King's O
officials O
had O
formerly O
made O
private O
bargains O
at O
' O
colloquies O
of O
merchants O
' O
, O
and O
whose O
payments O
were O
now O
authorized O
by O
parliamentary O
sanction O
at O
a O
rate O
roughly B-CARDINAL
fifty I-CARDINAL
per O
cent O
in O
excess O
of O
the O
rate O
for O
native O
merchants O
. O

In O
addition O
to O
these O
revenues O
, O
the O
King O
had O
the O
financial O
benefits O
of O
his O
position O
at O
the O
head O
of O
the O
feudal O
system O
, O
as O
its O
chief O
landowner O
and O
the O
recipient O
of O
the O
fines O
of O
royal O
justice O
. O

It O
was O
, O
therefore O
, O
a O
complicated O
and O
not O
very O
satisfactory O
financial O
system O
in O
which O
the O
borders O
between O
private O
and O
public O
purse O
were O
as O
ill-defined O
as O
the O
borders O
between O
private O
and O
national O
war O
, O
and O
in O
which O
the O
comparati- O
vely O
simple O
obligations O
of O
the O
feudal O
pyramid O
But O
this O
time O
there O
was O
a O
very O
interesting O
attempt O
to O
apply O
a O
sliding O
scale O
to O
the O
payments O
demanded O
. O

The O
definition O
of O
an O
adult O
was O
altered O
to O
read O
' O
over B-CARDINAL
sixteen I-CARDINAL
' O
, O
and O
, O
where O
the O
poorest O
were O
to O
pay O
a O
groat O
, O
the O
Duke O
of O
Lancaster B-LOCATION
and O
the O
Archbishops O
of O
Canterbury B-LOCATION
and O
York B-LOCATION
were O
to O
pay O
ten B-CARDINAL
marks O
, O
and O
between O
these O
two B-CARDINAL
extremes O
a O
graduated O
scale O
of O
payments O
was O
fixed O
for O
the O
different O
classes O
of O
laymen O
and O
clerics O
. O

Again O
the O
resentment O
was O
widespread O
and O
the O
results O
disappointing O
- O
a O
tax O
estimated O
to O
yield O
50,000 B-CARDINAL
in O
fact O
raised O
only B-CARDINAL
27,000 I-CARDINAL
. O

In O
the B-TIME
following I-TIME
year I-TIME
, O
1380 B-TIME
, O
the O
last O
and O
most O
notorious O
third B-CARDINAL
poll-tax O
was O
agreed O
by O
a O
Parliament B-ORGANIZATION
which O
met O
at O
Northampton B-LOCATION
. O

There O
were O
dark O
reasons O
for O
a O
meeting O
so O
far O
away O
from O
the O
capital O
in O
a O
town O
with O
poor O
communications O
and O
not O
over O
supplied O
with O
hostelries O
and O
lodgings O
. O

London B-LOCATION
was O
again O
in O
turmoil O
; O
but O
this O
time O
over O
a O
question O
of O
trade O
rivalry O
. O

A O
rich O
mer- O
chant O
from O
Genoa B-LOCATION
had O
been O
murdered O
, O
and O
John B-PERSON
de I-PERSON
Kyrkby I-PERSON
, O
a O
Londoner B-NORP
, O
was O
one O
of O
those O
charged O
with O
the O
crime O
. O

It O
is O
clear O
from O
the O
chronicles O
that O
this O
was O
a O
sordid O
quarrel O
between O
monopolists O
and O
interlopers O
. O

The O
city O
merchants O
were O
jealous O
of O
foreign O
merchants O
who O
could O
tempt O
court O
and O
baronage O
with O
rarer O
luxuries O
than O
those O
A O
sum O
of O
160,000 B-CARDINAL
was O
demanded O
- O
a O
staggering O
figure O
to O
mediaeval O
eyes O
. O

It O
was O
determined O
that O
100,000 B-CARDINAL
was O
a O
fairer O
target O
, O
and O
the O
Parliament B-ORGANIZATION
agreed O
to O
find O
two-thirds B-CARDINAL
of O
this O
sum O
providing O
the O
clergy O
supplied O
the O
remainder O
. O

The O
method O
of O
assessment O
to O
which O
the O
Commons B-ORGANIZATION
agreed O
was O
that O
of O
the O
first B-CARDINAL
poll-tax O
. O

The O
manifest O
injustice O
of O
this O
method O
had O
been O
to O
a O
certain O
degree O
corrected O
by O
the O
sliding O
scale O
of O
the O
second B-CARDINAL
poll-tax O
, O
but O
this O
lesson O
was O
ignored O
, O
and O
the O
injustice O
trebled O
in O
weight O
by O
a O
flat-rate O
tax O
at O
treble O
the O
rate O
- O
every O
adult O
had O
to O
pay O
three B-CARDINAL
groats O
, O
but O
this O
time O
an O
adult O
was O
re- O
Trebling O
the O
rate O
was O
arrived O
at O
by O
a O
simple O
arithmetic O
which O
argued O
that O
, O
as O
the O
first B-CARDINAL
poll-tax O
had O
supplied O
22,000 B-CARDINAL
, O
a O
tax O
of O
three B-CARDINAL
times O
the O
rate O
would O
produce O
66,000 B-CARDINAL
. O

The O
only O
concession O
made O
in O
view O
of O
the O
objections O
to O
the O
first B-CARDINAL
two I-CARDINAL
poll-taxes O
was O
the O
suggestion O
that O
the O
rich O
should O
help O
the O
poor O
- O
but O
this O
was O
only O
a O
pious O
hope O
because O
no O
machinery O
was O
provided O
for O
carrying O
it O
into O
effect O
, O
and O
a O
subordinate O
In O
Chapter O
Two B-CARDINAL
he O
gauged O
the O
nature O
of O
the O
heart's O
movements O
from O
the O
dissection O
of O
living O
animals O
, O
showing O
how O
these O
move- O

alternate O
with O
rests O
and O
are O
seen O
best O
in O
cold O
animals O
or O
in O
flagging O
warmer O
ones O
. O

At O
the O
time O
of O
its O
movement O
the O
heart O
becomes O
generally O
constricted O
, O
its O
walls O
thicken O
, O
its O
ventricles O
decrease O
in O
volume O
and O
it O
expels O
its O
content O
of O
blood O
, O
appearing O
paler O
in O
so O
doing O
in O
animals O
such O
as O
serpents O
, O
frogs O
, O
and O
the O
like O

At O
one B-CARDINAL
and O
the O
same O
time O
, O
therefore O
, O
occur O
the O
beat O
of O
the O
apex O
, O
the O
thickening O
of O
the O
heart O
walls O
, O
and O
the O
forcible O
expulsion O
of O
their O

by O
the O
contraction O
of O
the O
ventricles O

Going O
on O

Chapter O
Three B-CARDINAL
to O

movement O
of O
the O
arteries O
, O
likewise O
gauged O
from O
the O
dissections O
of O

Harvey B-PERSON
noted O
that O
contraction O
of O
the O
heart O
and O
the O
apex O
beat O
occur O
in O
systole O
, O
simultaneously O
with O
dilatation O
of O
the O
arteries O
and O
of O
the O
artery-like O
vein O
, O
and O
expulsion O
of O
the O
ventricular O
content O
. O

Arterial O
pulsation O
disappears O
with O
cessation O
of O
ventricular O
contraction O
. O

During O
cutting O
or O
puncture O
of O
the O
ventricles O
, O
there O
is O
often O
forcible O
expulsion O
of O
blood O
from O
the O
wound O
. O

Arterial O
diastole O
is O
thus O
synchronous O
with O
cardiac O
systole O
but O
, O
when O
movement O
of O
blood O
through O
arteries O
is O
hindered O
by O
compression O
, O
infarction O
or O
inter- O
ception O
, O
the O
more O
distal O
arteries O
pulsate O
less O
because O
their O
pulse O
is O
nothing O
other O
than O
the O
impulse O
of O
the O
blood O
entering O
them O

the O
other O
80 B-CARDINAL

this O
remarkable O

raised O
the O

showed O
the O
worth O

) O
Soon O
they O
were O
good O
enough O
to O
sing O
at O

One O
of O
the O
helpful O
by-products O
was O
that O
they O
were O
able O
to O

they O
wore O
a O

one B-CARDINAL

Although O
his O

Just O

Alf B-PERSON
Barton I-PERSON
, O
who O
in O
1911 B-TIME
was O
presented O
with O
a O
book O
on O
the O
life O
of O
Marx B-PERSON
, O
and O
a O
gold O
purse O
in O
recognition O
of O
his O
work O
for O
the O
movement O
, O
was O
later O
known O
to O
say O
that O
it O
was O
not O
ne- O
cessary O
to O
understand O
Marxism O
in O
order O
to O
understand O
socialism O
, O
though O
at O
this O
time O
he O
was O
a O
keen O
member O
of O
the O
B.S.P. B-ORGANIZATION
. O

Dr. O
Davidson B-PERSON
said O
he O
would O
go O
for O
a O
walk O
over O
the O
fields O
while O
we O
attended O
to O
our O
business O
. O

To O
my O
amusement O
, O
when O
we O
met O
at O
tea O
at O
the O
rectory O
after O
the O
Dedication O
, O
the O
Archbishop O
said O
he O
had O
been O
stopped O
by O
a O
farmer O
in O
a O
field O
. O

He O
seemed O
rather O
indignant O
, O
but O
we O
took O
the O
episode O
without O
a O
smile O
till O
afterwards O
. O

The O
Hall O
proved O
most O
useful O
, O
especially O
in O
winter B-TIME
when O
the O
distance O
to O
the O
church O
deterred O
many O
from O
coming O
to O
Sunday B-TIME
Evensong O
. O

We O
managed O
to O
furnish O
a O
table O
with O
cross O
and O
candles O
, O
and O
the O
people O
appreciated O
the O
Church B-LOCATION
Hall I-LOCATION
for O
worship O
as O
well O
as O
for O
more O
secular O
purposes O
. O

In O
1910 B-TIME
Dr. O
Talbot B-PERSON
was O
translated O
to O
Winchester B-LOCATION
, O
and O
Dr. O
Hubert B-PERSON
Burge I-PERSON
became O
Bishop O
of O
Southwark B-LOCATION
. O

Meanwhile O
I O
had O
been O
asked O
to O
do O
a O
bit O
of O
Diocesan O
work O
in O
connection O
with O
Higher O
Religious O
Education O
, O
and O
to O
become O
the O
Southwark B-LOCATION
Secretary O
of O
the O
Church B-ORGANIZATION
Reading I-ORGANIZATION
Union I-ORGANIZATION
. O

This O
meant O
organizing O
lectures O
and O
courses O
of O
religious O
instruction O
through O
the O
Diocese O
, O
and O
I O
also O
found O
myself O
a O
member O
of O
the O
Diocesan B-ORGANIZATION
Conference I-ORGANIZATION
, O
where O
I O
remember O
introducing O
myself O
as O
the O
incumbent O
of O
the O
highest O
church O
in O
the O
Diocese O
. O

There O
was O
a O
somewhat O
shocked O
atmosphere O
in O
some O
quarters O
, O
until O
I O
explained O
that O
my O
church O
was O
800 B-CARDINAL
feet O
high O
above O
the O
sea O
level O
! O

The O
work O
was O
growing O
pretty O
heavy O
, O
and O
we O
managed O
to O
get O
a O
stipendiary O
layman O
who O
could O
help O
among O
the O
children O
and O
young O
people O
. O

After O
the O
First B-CARDINAL
World O
War O
, O
1914 B-TIME
, O
I O
did O
not O
visit O
Germany B-LOCATION
for O
ten B-TIME
years I-TIME
, O
by O
which O
time O
in O
1924 B-TIME
I O
was O
in O
a O
different O
parish O
in O
Surrey B-LOCATION
. O

Towards O
the O
end O
of O
my O
five B-TIME
and I-TIME
a I-TIME
half I-TIME
years' I-TIME
incumbency O
I O
was O
asked O
if O
I O
would O
start O
a O
village O
choral O
society O
and O
conduct O
it O
. O

This O
opened O
up O
a O
new O
interest O
, O
and O
we O
plunged O
into O
it O
. O

IN O
1913 B-TIME
Dr. O
Burge B-PERSON
, O
Bishop O
of O
Southwark B-LOCATION
, O
asked O
me O
to O
go O
as O
Vicar O
of O
St. B-LOCATION
Mark's I-LOCATION
, O
Woodcote B-LOCATION
, O
Purley B-LOCATION
, O
a O
new O
church O
built O
by O
the O
well-known O
architect O
Mr. O
George B-PERSON
Fellowes I-PERSON
Prynne I-PERSON
, O
who O
was O
to O
become O
a O
very O
intimate O
friend O
, O
and O
I O
was O
later O
on O
joint O
executor O
of O
his O
estate O
with O
his O
solicitor O
cousin O
. O

As O
Bishop O
Talbot B-PERSON
had O
told O
me O
that O
I O
ought O
not O
to O
spend O
many B-TIME
years I-TIME
in O
Tatsfield B-LOCATION
, O
we O
held O
great O
family O
consultations O
. O

My O
eldest O
brother O
was O
then O
living O
in O
Limpsfield B-LOCATION
with O
his O
family O
, O
and O
found O
a O
very O
suitable O
house O
nearby O
where O
my O
mother O
settled O
, O
and O
eventually O
died O
in O
1926 B-TIME
at O
the B-TIME
age I-TIME
of I-TIME
92 I-TIME
. O

Dr. O
Burge B-PERSON
was O
not O
able O
to O
be O
present O
at O
the O
Institution B-ORGANIZATION
and I-ORGANIZATION
Induction I-ORGANIZATION
Service I-ORGANIZATION
in O
St. B-LOCATION
Mark's I-LOCATION
. O

This O
was O
taken O
by O
the O
Suffragan O
Bishop O
of O
Woolwich B-LOCATION
, O
Dr. O
John B-PERSON
Leake I-PERSON
, O
who O
lived O
at O
Blackheath B-LOCATION
, O
and O
was O
a O
close O
friend O
of O
ours O
. O

It O
was O
very O
interesting O
to O
have O
the O
privilege O
of O
filling O
such O
a O
beautiful O
building O
with O
suitable O
fittings O
; O
I O
made O
a O
rule O
that O
all O
gifts O
should O
be O
submitted O
for O
approval O
to O
the O
architect O
, O
himself O
a O
fine O
artist O
. O

It O
is O
quite O
possible O
to O
put O
beautiful O
things O
into O
a O
beautiful O
church O
and O
yet O
spoil O
the O
building O
with O
ornaments O
unsui- O
table O
to O
the O
environs O
. O

We O
also O
had O
a O
little O
Mission O
Hall O
leading O
off O
the O
Brighton B-LOCATION
Road I-LOCATION
, O
in O
a O
street O
full O
of O
small O
houses O
. O

This O
was O
called O
Ellen B-LOCATION
Avenue I-LOCATION
when O
I O
first B-CARDINAL
went O
there O
, O
but O
was O
soon O
changed O
into O
the O
better- O
sounding O
name O
of O
Lansdowne B-LOCATION
Road I-LOCATION
. O

There O
were O
lots O
of O
children O
there O
, O
and O
we O
had O
a O
flourishing O
Sunday B-TIME
School O
and O
an O
evening B-TIME
service O
. O

I O
soon O
saw O
that O
the O
parish O
needed O
more O
help O
both O
at O
the O
church O
and O
Mission O
district O
. O

The O
Church B-ORGANIZATION
Army I-ORGANIZATION
Captain O
had O
done O
very O
good O
work O
in O
the O
Lansdowne B-LOCATION
Road I-LOCATION
district O
, O
but O
I O
needed O
more O
help O
in O
the O
church O
for O
the O
full O
rota O
of O
services O
on O
Sundays B-TIME
and O
weekdays B-TIME
. O

Most O
fortunately O
I O
was O
able O
to O
engage O
the O
Rev. O
E. B-PERSON
U. I-PERSON
Evitt I-PERSON
in O
1913 B-TIME
soon O
after O
I O
had O
come O
, O
and O
he O
organized O
the O
Mission O
district O
and O
got O
to O
know O
, O
and O
be O
known O
by O
, O
many O
of O
the O
people O
of O
the O
parish O
. O

A O
great O
blow O
disturbed O
all O
our O
efforts O
in O
the O
following B-TIME
year I-TIME
, O
1914 B-TIME
, O
when O
war O
broke O
out O
. O

Very O
soon O
Chaplains O
for O
the O
Forces O
were O
urgently O
needed O
, O
and O
I O
felt O
clearly O
that O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
us O
must O
volunteer O
. O

The O
Bishop O
, O
Dr. O
Burge B-PERSON
, O
did O
not O
wish O
me O
to O
go O
then O
, O
as O
I O
had O
barely O
been O
in O
the O
parish O
for O
a B-TIME
year I-TIME
. O

Mr. O
Evitt B-PERSON
, O
however O
, O
was O
much O
less O
committed O
than O
his O
Vicar O
, O
and O
he O
was O
accepted O
at O
once O
and O
was O
very O
soon O
in O
France B-LOCATION
where O
he O
did O
splendid O
work O
until O
his O
health O
broke O
down O
and O
he O
had O
a O
bad O
attack O
of O
enteric O
fever O
. O

Meanwhile O
in O
Purley B-LOCATION
there O
was O
much O
activity O
and O
much O
co-operation O
especially O
with O
the O
other O
Christian B-NORP
communities O
. O

At O
a O
large O
public O
meeting O
we O
launched O
the O
project O
known O
as O
the O
' O
Coulsdon B-ORGANIZATION
and I-ORGANIZATION
Purley I-ORGANIZATION
Patriotic I-ORGANIZATION
Fund I-ORGANIZATION
' O
in O
whose O
counsels O
and O
committees O
I O
found O
myself O
deeply O
involved O
. O

At O
first B-CARDINAL
, O
the O
main O
work O
was O
to O
help O
wives O
and O
relations O
of O
the O
soldiers O
to O
get O
their O
' O
Separation O
' O
allowances O
, O
but O
soon O
, O
alas O
! O

, O
as O
casualties O
began O
and O
increased O
in O
the B-TIME
winter I-TIME
of I-TIME
1914 I-TIME
and I-TIME
1915 I-TIME
the O
matter O
of O
War O
Pensions O
became O
very O
urgent O
, O
and O
I O
was O
asked O
to O
be O
Chairman O
of O
the O
Committee B-ORGANIZATION
in O
Coulsdon B-LOCATION
and O
Purley B-LOCATION
. O

Indeed O
, O
for O
the O
next O
seventeen B-TIME
years I-TIME
, O
during O
my O
time O
at O
Purley B-LOCATION
, O
and O
from O
1922 B-TIME
at O
Surbiton B-LOCATION
, O
I O
was O
continuously O
Chairman O
of O
the O
local O
War B-ORGANIZATION
Pensions I-ORGANIZATION
Committee I-ORGANIZATION
. O

This O
task O
involved O
a O
very O
great O
deal O
of O
detailed O
work O
for O
the O
Committee B-ORGANIZATION
. O

We O
had O
a O
splendid O
body O
of O
local O
residents O
, O
and O
a O
series O
of O
excellent O
Honorary O
Secretaries O
. O

Our O
Committee B-ORGANIZATION
met O
once O
a O
week O
in O
the O
evenings O
, O
and O
included O
professional O
men O
from O
every O
walk O
of O
life O
. O

Very O
soon O
we O
managed O
to O
get O
a O
hut O
in O
Purley B-LOCATION
where O
soldiers O
were O
very O
welcome O
and O
the O
ladies O
organized O
a O
canteen O
. O

Life O
was O
in O
those O
years O
more O
than O
busy O
. O

We O
now O
had O
a O
vicarage O
next O
to O
the O
church O
, O
and O
I O
was O
most O
fortunate O
in O
having O
for O
eight B-TIME
years I-TIME
a O
most O
able O
and O
devoted O
housekeeper O
whom O
I O
had O
known O
well O
in O
Limpsfield B-LOCATION
where O
she O
had O
a O
house O
next O
to O
the O
church O
. O

On O
hearing O
that O
I O
was O
to O
leave O
Tatsfield B-LOCATION
and O
come O
to O
Purley B-LOCATION
she O
offered O
to O
come O
and O
look O
after O
me O
. O

She O
was O
a O
real O
treasure O
, O
of O
yeoman O
stock O
and O
clever O
in O
all O
domestic O
things O
, O
a O
widow O
who O
knew O
how O
to O
look O
after O
the O
' O
boy O
, O
' O
who O
was O
the O
only O
other O
occupant O
of O
the O
house O
when O
Mr. O
Evitt B-PERSON
had O
gone O
. O

Speaking O
of O
churchwardens O
and O
children O
leads O
me O
at O
once O
to O
chronicle O
a O
most O
intimate O
and O
lasting O
friendship O
begun O
in O
1913 B-TIME
in O
Purley B-LOCATION
and O
continuing O
till O
old O
age O
to-day O
. O

When O
I O
went O
to O
St. B-LOCATION
Mark's I-LOCATION
, O
the O
first B-CARDINAL
contact O
I O
made O
was O
with O
the O
Vicar's O
Warden O
, O
Mr. O
F. B-PERSON
W. I-PERSON
Charlton I-PERSON
and O
his O
family O
, O
the O
youngest O
of O
whose O
three B-CARDINAL
sons O
was O
just O
coming O
into O
the O
world O
in O
this B-TIME
year I-TIME
of I-TIME
1913 I-TIME
. O

Less O
than O
no O
response O
from O
the O
Russian B-NORP
side O
led O
one O
to O
fear O
that O
the O
event O
might O
well O
have O
the O
outcome O
that O
the O
Nazis B-NORP
evidently O
hoped O
might O
lead O
to O
disaster O
. O

Then O
there O
had O
been O
much O
talk O
of O
the O
setting O
up O
among O
the O
German B-NORP
population O
of O
a O
general O
system O
of O
" O

The O
Nazi B-NORP
fortress O
concept O
turned O
out O
to O
be O
nothing O
more O
than O
a O
fantasy O
. O

Thanks O
to O
the O
good O
sense O
of O
the O
front O
line O
soldiers O
, O
the O
meeting O
of O
East B-LOCATION
and O
West B-LOCATION
was O
marked O
by O
the O
use O
of O
no O
weapon O
more O
lethal O
than O
vodka O
. O

And O
the O
effect O
on O
the O
German B-NORP
people O
of O
the O
first B-TIME
ten I-TIME
years I-TIME
of O
the O
promised O
thousand B-CARDINAL
of O
Nazi B-NORP
rule O
, O
so O
far O
from O
creating O
a O
spirit O
of O
warlike O
frenzy O
, O
had O
produced O
universally O
a O
dull O
bewildered O
apathy O
. O

Their O
friendship O
for O
Augusta B-PERSON
became O
rather O
hollow O
, O
and O
the O
news O
that O
Byron B-PERSON
had O
left O
her O
practically O
all O
his O
money O
caused O
it O
to O
crumble O
to O
oblivion O
. O

Though O
Lady O
Byron B-PERSON
knew O
perfectly O
well O
that O
Byron B-PERSON
, O
as O
early O
as O
the O
year O
of O
their O
wedding O
, O
1815 B-TIME
, O
had O
made O
a O
will O
in O
Augusta's B-PERSON
favour O
, O
she O
had O
evidently O
not O
passed O
on O
that O
information O
; O
and O
it O
came O
as O
an O
appalling O
surprise O
to O
Captain O
Byron B-PERSON
that O
he O
had O
been O
left O
without O
the O
fortune O
that O
would O
keep O
up O
the O
title O
. O

The O
questions O
about O
children O
were O
the O
same O
as O
in O
1951 B-TIME
, O
except O
that O
they O
extended O
to O
all O
women O
who O
were O
or O
had O
been O
married O
. O

It O
was O
not O
regarded O
as O
practicable O
within O
the O
limits O
of O
the O
census O
to O
include O
particulars O
about O
the O
date O
of O
birth O
of O
each O
child O
, O
as O
had O
been O
done O
in O
the O
specialised O
enquiry O
for O
the O
Royal B-ORGANIZATION
Commission I-ORGANIZATION
. O

Nevertheless O
, O
average O
net O
family O
income O
was O
appreciably O
higher O
in O
families O
with O
several O
children O
than O
in O
those O
with O
only O
, O
many O
of O
which O
were O
incomplete O
families O
of O
younger O
parents O
with O
lower O
earnings O
, O
and O
of O
course O
with O
lower O
tax O
reliefs O
and O
no O
family O
allowances O
. O

The O
rise O
in O
net O
family O
incomes O
between B-TIME
1954 I-TIME
and I-TIME
1959 I-TIME
was O
great- O
est O
for O
childless O
couples O
, O
especially O
older O
couples O
( O
probably O
because O
of O
the O
' O
Are O
you O
enjoying O
yourself O
, O
Olimpia B-PERSON
? O

' O
she O
asked O
idly O
, O
tapping O
the O
girl's O
cheek O
lightly O
with O
her O
fan O
, O
in O
passing O
; O
but O
she O
did O
not O
wait O
for O
the O
answer O
. O

Disturbed O
by O
vague O
uneasiness O
, O
she O
was O
wondering O
whether O
Olimpia B-PERSON
had O
been O
watching O
her O
talk O
with O
Orsini B-PERSON
. O

Surely O
she O
could O
not O
have O
overheard O
anything O
they O
said O
? O

A O
moment's O
reflection O
reassured O
her O
on O
that O
point O
, O
for O
she O
was O
certain O
no O
one O
had O
been O
standing O
near O
them O
. O

NO O
ONE O
has O
ever O
satisfactorily O
explained O
how O
a O
single-decker O
Welsh B-NORP
bus O
could O
have O
got O
itself O
into O
orbit O
. O

Shooting O
up O
over O
the O
pass O
a O
bit O
too O
carefree O
, O
and O
becoming O
airborne O
? O

Caught O
by O
a O
sudden O
gust O
of O
wind O
? O

A O
combination O
of O
the O
two B-CARDINAL
? O

No O
one O
seems O
to O
know O
. O

But O
the O
fact O
remains O
that O
get O
itself O
into O
orbit O
it O
did O
. O

And O
a O
fine O
old O
fuss O
there O
was O
about O
it O
, O
too O
. O

Here O
are O
the O
known O
facts O

the O

Ifor B-PERSON

For O
there O
was O
his O

, O
Dai B-PERSON
Pugh I-PERSON
, O
taking O
a O
tearful O
farewell O
of O
Morfydd B-PERSON
Owen I-PERSON

Morfydd B-PERSON
, O
who O
had O
until O
recently O
been O
Ifor's B-PERSON
typist O
, O
but O
was O
now O
returning O
to O
her O
home O
town O
as O
a O
fully-fledged O
schoolteacher O
. O

" O
But O
I O
'm O
only O
going O
fifteen B-CARDINAL
miles O
away O
, O
" O
Morfydd B-PERSON
was O
saying O
. O

" O
Not O
the O
end O
of O
the O
world O
, O
is O
it O
? O

" O
" O
For O
me O
it O
is O
, O
" O
Dai B-PERSON
said O
wretchedly O
, O
wiping O
his O
hands O
on O
his O
overalls O
preparatory O
to O
a O
last O
embrace O
. O

" O
You O
will O
not O
be O
remembering O
a O
mere O
garage O

when O
you O

lording O
it O
over O
the O
Mixed O
Infants O
of O
Llangrwl B-LOCATION

" O
" O
Silly O
boy O
, O
" O
said O
Morfydd B-PERSON
. O

Though O
she O
could O
not O
help O
wondering O
whether O
, O
now O
she O
had O
qualified O
as O
a O
schoolteacher O
, O
poor O
little O
Dai B-PERSON
was O
quite O
the O
man O
for O
her O
. O

A O
nice O
boy O
of O
course O
. O

But O
perhaps O
in O
the O
new O
world O
she O
was O
entering O
there O
might O
be O
boys O
equally O
nice O
, O
and O
with O
far O
more O
to O
offer O
. O

The O
conductor O
rang O
his O
bell O
. O

" O
Good-bye O
, O
Dai B-PERSON
, O
" O
said O
Morfydd B-PERSON
, O
smiling O
from O
the O
bottom O
step O
. O

" O
Good-bye O
, O
Morfydd B-PERSON
. O

" O
He O
sought O
to O
enfold O
her O
in O
his O
arms O
. O

But O
he O
was O
too O
late O
. O

She O
was O
already O
up O
the O
bus O
steps O
, O
and O
the O
bus O
was O
away O
. O

And O
Morfydd B-PERSON
Owen I-PERSON
waving O
, O
unkissed O
, O
from O
the O
window O
. O

And O
Dai B-PERSON
, O
on O
the O
pavement O
, O
knowing O
in O
his O
heart O
that O
Morfydd B-PERSON
was O
leaving O
him O
as O
surely O
as O
she O
was O
leaving O
Dinas B-LOCATION
. O

So O
the O
bus O
set O
out O
for O
Llangrwl B-LOCATION
. O

But O
it O
never O
reached O
there O
! O

Somewhere O
, O
on O
those B-CARDINAL
fifteen I-CARDINAL
miles O
of O
mountain O
roads O
, O
it O
disappeared O
from O
the O
earthly O
scene O
. O

The O
first B-CARDINAL
intimation O
that O
all O
was O
not O
well O
came O
when O
a O
Mr. O
Isaiah B-PERSON
Roberts I-PERSON

And O
so O
did O

How O

reported O

they O
could O

People O
were O
always O
losing O

You O
'd O
be O
surprised O

they O
said O

So O
it O
seemed O
, O
for O
a O
time O

that O
the O
whole O
affair O
would O
be O
written O
off O
as O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
those O

the O
Marie B-PERSON

things O

to O

But O
what O
about O
the O
voyagers O

you O
will O
be O
asking O

Well O
, O
the O
Rev. O
Edwards B-PERSON
had O
taken O

" O
Our O
position O
, O
" O
he O
said O
, O
" O
is O
somewhat O
analogous O
to O
that O
of O
a O

Now O
what O
does O
such O
a O

do O
? O

He O
signals O
his O

by O
lighting O

hoisting O

on O
a O

But O
Lily-yo B-PERSON

were O
listening O

' O
To O
this O

as O

it O
, O
we O
come O
to O

' O
Lily-yo B-PERSON
said O
, O
doubtingly O
. O

The O
Captive O
with O
the O
fleshless O
jaw O
said O
, O
' O
The O
grub O
of O
the O

it O
changes O

' O
' O
You O

the O
Chief O

' O
You O
begin O
newly O
here O

Where O
are O
your O
souls O
? O

' O
Lily-yo B-PERSON
and O
Flor B-PERSON
looked O
at O
each O
other O
. O

In O
their O
flight O
from O
the O
4wiltmilt O
they O
had O
heedlessly O
thrown O
down O
their O
souls O
. O

Haris B-PERSON
had O
trampled O
on O
his O
. O

It O
was O
unthinkable O
! O

' O
You O
see O
. O

You O
needed O
them O
no O
more O
. O

You O
are O
still O
young O
. O

You O
may O
be O
able O
to O
have O
babies O
. O

Some O
of O
those O
babies O
may O
be O
born O
with O
wings O
. O

' O
The O
Captive O
with O
the O
boneless O
arms O
added O
, O
' O
Some O
may O
be O
born O
wrong O
, O
as O
we O
are O
. O

Some O
may O
be O
born O
right O

' O
' O
You O
are O
too O
foul O
to O
live O
! O

' O
Haris B-PERSON
growled O
. O

' O
Why O
are O
you O
not O
killed O
? O

' O
' O
Because O
we O
know O
all O
things O
, O
' O
the O
Chief O
Captive O
said O
. O

Suddenly O
his O
second B-CARDINAL
head O
roused O
itself O
and O
declared O
, O
' O
To O
be O
a O
good O
shape O
is O
not O
all O
in O
life O
. O

To O
know O
is O
also O
good O
. O

Because O
we O
cannot O
move O
well O
we O
can O
- O
think O
. O

This O
tribe O
of O
the O
True B-LOCATION
World I-LOCATION
is O
good O
and O
knows O
these O
things O
. O

So O
it O
lets O
us O
rule O
it O
. O

' O
Flor B-PERSON
and O
Lily-yo B-PERSON
muttered O
together O
. O

' O
Do O
you O
say O
that O
you O
poor O
Captives O
rule O
the O
True B-LOCATION
World I-LOCATION
? O

' O
Lily-yo B-PERSON
asked O
at O
last O
. O

' O
We O
do O
. O

' O
' O
Then O
why O
are O
you O
captives O
? O

' O
The O
flyman O
with O
ear O
lobes O
and O
thumbs O
connected O
, O
making O
his O
perpetual O
little O
gesture O
of O
protest O
, O
spoke O
for O
the O
first B-CARDINAL
time O
. O

' O
To O
rule O
is O
to O
serve O
, O
woman O
. O

Those O
who O
bear O
power O
are O
slaves O
to O
it O
. O

Only O
an O
outcast O
is O
free O
. O

Because O
we O
are O
Captives O
, O
we O
have O
the O
time O
to O
talk O
and O
think O
and O
plan O
and O
know O

Those O
who O
know O
command O
the O

of O

' O
' O
No O

come O
to O
you O

' O
You O
will O
live O
among O
us O

' O
' O
No O

' O
the O
Chief O

said O
with O
both O
mouths O
. O

' O
Before O
she O
can O
enjoy O

Lily-yo B-PERSON
and O
her O
companion O
Flor B-PERSON

this O

help O
our O
great O

' O
' O
The O

? O

' O
Bondi B-PERSON
asked O
. O

' O
What O
else O
? O

Flor B-PERSON
and O
Lily-yo B-PERSON
, O
you O
arrive O
here O
at O
a O
good O
time O
. O

Memories O
of O
the O
Heavy B-LOCATION
World I-LOCATION
and O
its O
savage O
life O
are O
still O
fresh O
in O
you O
. O

We O
need O
such O
memories O
. O

So O
we O
ask O
you O
to O
go O
back O
there O
on O
a O
great O
plan O
we O
have O
. O

' O
' O
Go O
back O
? O

' O
gasped O
Flor B-PERSON
. O

' O
Yes O
. O

We O
plan O
to O
attack O
the O
Heavy B-LOCATION
World I-LOCATION
. O

You O
must O
help O
to O
lead O
our O
force O
. O

' O
The O
long O
afternoon B-TIME
of O
eternity O
wore O
on O
, O
that O
long O
golden O
road O
of O
an O
afternoon B-TIME
that O
would O
somewhere O
lead O
to O
everlasting O
night B-TIME
. O

Motion O
there O
was O
, O
but O
motion O
without O
event O
- O
except O
for O
those O
negligible O
events O
that O
seemed O
so O
large O
to O
the O
creatures O
participating O
in O
them O
. O

For O
Lily-yo B-PERSON
, O
Flor B-PERSON
and O
Haris B-PERSON
there O
were O
many O
events O
. O

Chief O
of O
these O
was O
that O
they O
learned O
to O
fly O
properly O
. O

The O
pains O
associated O
with O
their O
wings O
soon O
died O
away O
as O
the O
wonderful O
new O
flesh O
and O
tendon O
strengthened O
. O

To O
sail O
up O
in O
the O
light O
gravity O
became O
an O
increasing O
delight O
- O
the O
ugly O
flopping O
movements O
of O
flymen O
on O
the O
Heavy B-LOCATION
World I-LOCATION
had O
no O
place O
here O
. O

It O
was O
all O
over O
and O
done O
with O
. O

For O
the O
time O
being O
Beryl B-PERSON
was O
content O
to O
let O
it O
go O
at O
that O
, O
but O
she O
resolved O
to O
have O
it O
out O
with O
Piers B-PERSON
when O
a O
reasonable O
opportunity O
presented O
itself O
. O

He O
must O
learn O
that O
he O
could O
not O
treat O
her O
with O
injustice O
and O
contempt O
, O
ignoring O
her O
explanations O
as O
though O
he O
were O
a O
schoolmaster O
and O
she O
a O
small O
, O
ignorant O
child O
. O

He O
gave O
her O
no O
chance O
of O
any O
private O
conversation O
that B-TIME
evening I-TIME
, O
for O
when O
Blanche B-PERSON
and O
Jack B-PERSON
left O
, O
he O
went O
with O
them O
. O

But O
next B-TIME
morning I-TIME
she O
insisted O
on O
his O
taking O
her O
out O
in O
the O
jeep O
- O
to O
find O
, O
if O
possible O
, O
Hubert B-PERSON
and O
his O
relations O
, O
and O
tell O
them O
of O
her O
great O
disappointment O
at O
being O
held O
up O
in O
Balicou B-LOCATION
. O

She O
wavered O
, O
and O
at O
last O
said O
slowly O
, O
" O
If O
you O
must O
drag O
the O
truth O
out O
of O
me O
, O
I O
must O
ask O
you O
to O
regard O
it O
as O
confidential O
. O

" O
" O
My O
dear O
Beryl B-PERSON
, O
don't O
tell O
me O
anything O
, O
if O
you O
'd O
rather O
not O
. O

" O
He O
was O
clearly O
startled O
by O
her O
words O
. O

" O
But O
remember O
, O
it O
was O
you O
, O
not O
I O
, O
who O
started O
this O
conversation O
. O

" O
" O
I O
know O
. O

Absurd O
as O
it O
may O
seem O
, O
I O
didn't O
want O
you O
to O
think O
badly O
of O
me O
. O

" O
She O
turned O
away O
from O
him O
to O
fondle O
Judy B-PERSON
, O
who O
, O
sensing O
something O
amiss O
, O
was O
nudging O
her O
in O
the O
endeavour O
to O
gain O
her O
attention O
. O

" O
The O
truth O
is O
that O
if O
I O
had O
absolutely O
insisted O
on O
sailing O
at O
the O
time O
originally O
arranged O
, O
Sir O
John B-PERSON
would O
have O
had O
it O
in O
for O
Guy B-PERSON
. O

You O
see O
, O
it O
was O
, O
apparently O
, O
through O
a O
mistake O
on O
Guy's B-PERSON
part O
that O
we O
missed O
seeing O
the O
flamingoes O
our O
first B-CARDINAL
morning B-TIME
on O
the O
island O
. O

" O
" O
What O
harm O
could O
possibly O
have O
come O
to O
Forrest B-PERSON
through O
Sir O
John's B-PERSON
nonsense O
? O

" O
Piers B-PERSON
could O
hardly O
have O
spoken O
with O
more O
contempt O
. O

A O
bully O
like O
that O
respects O
anyone O
who O
dares O
to O
stand O
up O
to O
him O
. O

" O
Beryl B-PERSON
tried O
to O
suppress O
the O
thought O
that O
this O
was O
precisely O
the O
remark O
she O
had O
made O
to O
Guy B-PERSON
. O

She O
said O
icily O
, O
" O
As O
you O
pride O
yourself O
on O
your O
knowledge O
of O
all O
the O
affairs O
of O
the O
island O
I O
needn't O
tell O
you O
that O
Sir O
John B-PERSON
Graybury I-PERSON
is O
one O
of O
Mr. O
Hewson's B-PERSON
most O
important O
customers O
. O

" O
" O
So O
what O
? O

You O
're O
not O
trying O
to O
say O
that O
Hewson B-PERSON
would O
victimise O
Forrest B-PERSON
for O
behaving O
with O
ordinary O
moral O
courage O
! O

He O
's O
quite O
capable O
of O
telling O
Sir O
John B-PERSON
to O
take O
himself O
and O
his O
business O
to O
an O
unmention- O
able O
destination O
. O

" O
" O
There O
's O
a O
difference O
between O
what O
a O
senior O
and O
a O
junior O
partner O
can O
do O
, O
" O
was O
her O
quick O
reply O
. O

" O
What O
they O
can O
bring O
off O
! O

I O
'll O
admit O
that O
. O

But O
Forrest B-PERSON
might O
at O
least O
have O
tried O
. O

He O
's O
pretty O
spineless O
! O

" O
" O
You O
think O
you O
could O
have O
carried O
more O
weight O
with O
Sir O
John B-PERSON
? O

" O
she O
enquired O
cuttingly O
. O

" O
For O
all O
your O
good O
opinion O
of O
yourself O
, O
I O
doubt O
it O
. O

He O
's O
about O
as O
easy O
to O
push O
around O
as O
- O
as O
a O
grounded O
whale O
! O

" O
He O
had O
to O
smile O
at O
that O
, O
but O
went O
on O
airily O
, O
" O
I O
'd O
have O
made O
an O
attempt O
to O
show O
my O
lady-love O
that O
I O
put O
her O
interests O
before O
my O
own O
. O

She O
was O
tempted O
to O
laugh O
, O
but O
it O
was O
as O
though O
that O
barb O
still O
stuck O
in O
her O
quivering O
flesh O
. O

" O
You O
've O
an O
answer O
- O
of O
sorts O
- O
for O
everything O
, O
" O
she O
said O
shortly O
. O

" O
Personally O
I O
've O
no O
more O
to O
say O
, O
so O
I O
suggest O
we O
get O
along O
. O

" O
To O
her O
great O
relief O
they O
arrived O
at O
the O
cluster O
of O
little O
houses O
where O
Hubert B-PERSON
had O
been O
living O
to O
find O
the O
old O
man O
stowing O
in O
leisurely O
fashion O
his O
few O
possessions O
into O
a O
ramshackle O
and O
incredibly O
ancient O
car O
, O
surrounded O
by O
innumerable O
friends O
and O
relatives O
. O

Bertram's B-PERSON
face O
was O
grim O
. O

" O
You O
think O
it O
was O
the O
Snort O
, O
don't O
you O
? O

" O
John B-PERSON
gave O
a O
short O
laugh O
. O

" O
I O
did O
, O
" O
he O
said O
; O
" O
but O
I O
'd O
better O
stop O
thinking O
that O
now O
. O

Pericles O
is O
fitted O
with O
an O
identically O
similar O
one O
. O

" O
" O
So O
there O
you O
are O
, O
my O
dear O
. O

" O
Peggy B-PERSON
's O
eyes O
filled O
with O
tears O
. O

" O
It O
's O
so O
unfair O
, O
" O
she O
said O
. O

" O
That O
little O
beast O
Robbie B-PERSON
Munyard I-PERSON
spent O
six B-TIME
months I-TIME
ashore O
while O
Pericles O
was O
refitting O
in O
the O
dockyard O
and O
now O
that O
she O
's O
ready O
for O
sea O
he O
goes O
sick O
. O

Just O
because O
he O
's O
an O
Honourable O
he O
can O
do O
what O
he O
likes O
. O

Anyway O
, O
why O
pick O
on O
you O
to O
succeed O
him O
? O

" O
John B-PERSON
didn't O
answer O
. O

There O
was O
no O
point O
in O
sharing O
his O
discomfort O
with O
Peggy B-PERSON
. O

So O
he O
put O
up O
for O
the O
night B-TIME
at O
The B-LOCATION
Admiral's I-LOCATION
Head I-LOCATION
, O
that O
famous O
Portsmouth B-LOCATION
hostelry O
, O
second B-CARDINAL
only O
in O
historic O
interest O
to O
The B-LOCATION
George I-LOCATION
, O
unhappily O
destroyed O
by O
German B-NORP
bombs O
during O
the O
last O
war O
. O

Having O
deposited O
his O
baggage O
and O
unpacked O
his O
overnight-bag O
he O
went O
in O
search O
of O
a O
drink O
. O

The O
lower O
bar O
was O
empty O
, O
save O
for O
the O
lady O
known O
by O
all O
habitue O
*?2s O
as O
' O
Seaweed B-PERSON
' O
, O
and O
a O
youngish O
, O
sharp-eyed O
man O
who O
was O
staring O
moodily O
into O
a O
gin O
and O
tonic O
. O

Seaweed's B-PERSON
memory O
was O
prodigious O
; O
her O
manner O
must O
have O
been O
worth O
a O
great O
deal O
to O
the O
proprietors O
of O
the O
hotel O
. O

She O
greeted O
John B-PERSON
, O
however O
, O
with O
less O
than O
her O
usual O
cordiality O
and O
flashed O
a O
warning O
glance O
at O
him O
. O

Evidently O
the O
other O
occupant O
of O
the O
bar O
was O
not O
6persona O
grata O
. O

If O
her O
memory O
was O
good O
, O
so O
was O
this O
stranger's O
. O

" O
You O
're O
Commander O
Winter B-PERSON
, O
" O
he O
said O
. O

" O
Have O
a O
gin O
? O

" O
He O
turned O
to O
Seaweed B-PERSON
- O
" O
Make O
it O
a O
large O
one O
, O
darling O

know O
the O
naval O
habits O

gin O
and O
call O
each O
other O
wallahs O
, O
what O
! O

' O
- O
as O
the O
Guards O
officer O
said O
on O
his O
return O
from O
a O
visit O
to O
the O
Royal B-ORGANIZATION

Should O

been O
a O
V.C. O
What O
are O
you O
waiting O
for O
, O
darling O
? O

The O
officer O
is O
obviously O
thirsty O
. O

" O
John B-PERSON
fought O
back O
his O
inherited O
desire O
to O
snub O
the O
man O
. O

If O
he O
did O
he O
would O
have O
to O
leave O
the O
bar O
and O
either O
sit O
in O
the O
lounge O
or O
return O
to O
his O
bedroom O
. O

Seaweed B-PERSON
sensed O
his O
embarrassment O
and O
came O
to O
the O
rescue O
. O

" O
You O
haven't O
introduced O
yourself O
, O
" O
she O
said O
with O
mock O
severity O
. O

" O
It O

Does O
that O

" O
It O

Ian B-PERSON

name O
was O
printed O
at O
the O

John B-PERSON
nodded O

John B-PERSON

his O

was O
on O
the O

a O

his O

Life O

been O
a O

down O

up O

We O
dismounted O

one B-CARDINAL
of O
the O
miners O
who O
'd O
come O
along O
with O
Nick B-PERSON
Dowd I-PERSON
took O
our O
horses O
off O
to O
water O

We O
followed O
Nick B-PERSON
Dowd I-PERSON
into O
the O
shack O
. O

They O
'd O
rigged O
up O
a O
stove O
of O
sorts O

on O
it O
a O
huge O
blackened O
coffee-pot O
steamed O

Other O
miners O
followed O
in O
at O
our O
heels O

Nick B-PERSON
Dowd I-PERSON
found O
us O
a O
couple O
of O
boxes O
to O
sit O
on O

A O
small O
man O
in O
bib O
overalls O
and O
a O
battered O

fussed O
around O
the O

said O
Dowd B-PERSON

He O
introduced O
the O
men O
who O
'd O
come O
in O
as O
Roper B-PERSON
Smith I-PERSON
, O
Shorty B-PERSON
, O
Mick B-PERSON
Golightly I-PERSON

the B-PERSON
Sodbuster I-PERSON

This O
last O
was O
the O
little O
hombre O
in O
big O
overalls O
. O

Very O
soon O
he O
had O
tin O
mugs O
filled O
with O
hot O
black O
coffee O
sweetened O
with O
molasses O
for O
all O
and O
for O
us O
there O
were O
two B-CARDINAL
plates O
of O
beans O
. O

" O
They O
gives O
you O
the O
wind O
, O
" O
said O
the B-PERSON
Sodbuster I-PERSON
handing O
them O
to O
us O
, O
" O
but O
it O
's O
all O
we O
got O
as O

now O
, O
apart O
from O
a O
few O
sacks O
of O
gold O

" O
He O
winked O
at O
his O

They O
all O
watched O
us O

ate O
the O
beans O

when O
we O
'd O
finished O
and O
I O
'd O
rolled O
a O
cigarette O

left O
the O

- O
I O
looked O
across O
at O
Nick B-PERSON
Dowd I-PERSON
- O
" O
someone O
cut O
down O
William B-PERSON
Appleton I-PERSON
outside O
the O
Palace B-LOCATION
with O
a O
shotgun O
. O

" O
I O
paused O
and O
watched O
my O
words O
affect O
them O
in O
their O
different O
ways O
. O

" O
That O
's O
sure O
bad O
news O

Dowd B-PERSON

sombrely O
. O

" O
It O

about O

everything O

Mr. O

observed O
Shorty B-PERSON
. O

The O
rest O
of O
the O
men O
there O
said O
nothing O
but O
you O
could O
see O
they O
were O
hard O
hit O
. O

They O
were O
simple O
men O
who O
knew O
a O
lot O
maybe O
about O
digging O
for O
gold O
but O
were O
babes O
in O
arms O
when O
it O
came O
to O
dealing O
with O
owlhooters O
and O
desperadoes O
like O
Pell B-PERSON
and O
Fenton B-PERSON
and O
the O
rest O
. O

" O
I O
guess O
we O
'd O
better O
hold O
onto O
the O
gold O
right O

Nick B-PERSON

" O
said O
the B-PERSON
Sodbuster I-PERSON

" O
Yeah O

" O
said O
Dowd B-PERSON
dubiously O
. O

" O
2Mebbe O
we O
'd O
better O

" O
Surprisingly O
Dan B-PERSON
Maffrey I-PERSON
came O
in O
at O
that O
point O
. O

" O
If O
you O
do O
, O
" O
he O
said O
, O
" O
you O
'll O
be O
sure O
asking O

They O
'll O
be O
on O
your O

It O
wouldn't O

the O

up O

They O
've O
done O
it O

away O
with O

" O
" O
You O

2durned O

" O
said O
the O
man O
called O
Roper B-PERSON
Smith I-PERSON

" O
We O
've O
got O
five B-CARDINAL
rifles O
among O
us O

a O
few O
six-shooters B-CARDINAL

But O
most O
of O
us O
2ain't O

" O
If O
you O

a O
chance O

your O

we O
'll O
abide O
by O
what O
we O
said O

said O
Dan B-PERSON

" O
We O
'll O
watch O
the O
stage O
out O
of O

" O
I O
couldn't O
quite O
see O
how O
all O
this O
fitted O
in O
with O
Dan B-PERSON
Maffrey's I-PERSON
aim O
to O
avenge O
himself O
on O
the O
Fenton B-PERSON
bunch O
but O
still O
it O
was O
a O
handsome O
offer O
so O
I O
chimed O
in O
too O
. O

" O
That O
goes O
for O
me O
, O
gentlemen O
, O
" O
I O
said O
. O

" O
If O
they O
do O
try O

hold O
up O
the O

it O
'll O
be O
a B-CARDINAL
couple I-CARDINAL
or I-CARDINAL
three I-CARDINAL
of O
them O
, O
no O
more O

I O
reckon O
we O
can O
deal O
with O
them O
all O
right O

" O
Gay B-PERSON
, O
a O
little O
puzzled O
, O
went O
through O
to O
the O
bar O
. O

Doc B-PERSON
and O
Lilyan B-PERSON
were O
sitting O
just O
inside O
having O
coffee O
. O

" O
Come O
and O
join O
us O
and O
bring O
your O
boy O
friend O
, O
" O
Doc B-PERSON
called O
. O

" O
No O
, O
Doc B-PERSON
! O

" O
Lilyan B-PERSON
remonstrated O
. O

" O
They O
want O
to O
be O
alone O
. O

" O
" O
I O
've O
booked O
a O
table O
at O
the O
cafe*?2 O
, O
" O
Doc B-PERSON
said O
, O
" O
they O
are O
packed O
tonight B-TIME
so O
come O
and O
join O
us O
if O
you O
can't O
find O
a O
table O
for O
two B-CARDINAL
. O

" O
Gay B-PERSON
thanked O
him O
and O
walked O
out O
on O
to O
the O
terrace O
thinking O
that O
perhaps O
Gavin B-PERSON
had O
bought O
a O
drink O
and O
taken O
it O
outside O
. O

She O
looked O
round O
scanning O
the O
tables O
, O
then O
caught O
her O
breath O
, O
a O
cold O
hand O
seeming O
to O
clutch O
her O
heart O
. O

Gavin B-PERSON
was O
seated O
at O
a O
small O
table O
in O
a O
shadowy O
corner O
talking O
animatedly O
to O
Simone B-PERSON
. O

As O
Gay B-PERSON
watched O
he O
offered O
the O
girl O
a O
cigarette O
and O
lit O
it O
, O
his O
hands O
cupping O
hers O
in O
an O
intimate O
way O
. O

Gay B-PERSON
stood O
irresolute O
for O
a O
moment O
, O
half B-CARDINAL
decided O
to O
go O
back O
and O
join O
Lilyan B-PERSON
and O
Doc B-PERSON
, O
while O
she O
wanted O
to O
do O
no O
more O
than O
run O
upstairs O
to O
her O
room O
, O
knowing O
that O
Gavin B-PERSON
although O
he O
had O
told O
her O
that O
he O
loved O
her O
, O
was O
already O
flirting O
with O
a O
girl O
that O
he O
had O
only O
met O
a B-TIME
few I-TIME
minutes I-TIME
before O
. O

Larry's B-PERSON
advice O
flashed O
through O
her O
mind O
, O
but O
she O
turned O
away O
, O
giving O
a O
little O
gesture O
of O
hopelessness O
, O
knowing O
that O
her O
The O
others O
were O
all O
dancing O
and O
as O
Gay B-PERSON
drew O
out O
a O
chair O
and O
sat O
down O
Gavin B-PERSON
, O
without O
a O
word O
, O
swept O
Simone B-PERSON
on O
to O
the O
floor O
. O

" O
It O
doesn't O
mean O
anything O
, O
" O
Gay B-PERSON
told O
herself O
desperately O
, O
trying O
to O
understand O
Gavin's B-PERSON
point O
of O
view O
and O
remembering O
the O
advice O
that O
Larry B-PERSON
had O
given O
her O
, O
while O
she O
felt O
wretched O
beyond O
words O
. O

" O
Neither O
can O
Nigel B-PERSON
, O
" O
smiled O
Diana B-PERSON
. O

" O
He O
's O
saving O
up O
to O
get O
married O
. O

Remember O
? O

" O
" O
I O
remember O
, O
" O
quipped O
the O
houseman O
, O
meaning O
no O
offence O
, O
" O
but O
does O
he O
? O

That O
blonde O
was O
something O
. O

" O
" O
Anybody O
I O
know O
? O

" O
she O
smiled O
. O

" O
I O
think O
so O
. O

I O
got O
a O
good O
look O
at O
her O
. O

But O
if O
Nigel B-PERSON
wasn't O
there O
it O
isn't O
important O
, O
is O
it O
? O

" O
" O
No O
, O
" O
Di B-PERSON
said O
immediately O
. O

" O
It O
isn't O
at O
all O
important O
. O

" O
" O
Oh O
, O
he O
wasn't O
. O

His O
motor-bike O
had O
broken O
down O
outside O
and O
he O
noticed O
your O
car O
and O
then O
you O
dancing O
with O
this O
blonde O
. O

" O
" O
Really O
? O

" O
Nigel B-PERSON
cocked O
one B-CARDINAL
eyebrow O
. O

" O
Actually O
she O
was O
brunette O
at O
the O
roots O
and O
I O
had O
a O
redhead O
on O
the O
other O
arm O
. O

He O
would O
have O
told O
you O
this O
, O
too O
? O

" O
" O
No O
, O
" O
she O
laughed O
. O

" O
He O
didn't O
actually O
see O
you O
. O

Because O
it O
was O
your O
car O
I O
suppose O
he O
presumed O
it O
was O
you O
, O
all O
dressed O
up O
in O
" O
My O
white O
or O
my O
black O
? O

" O
Nigel B-PERSON
enquired O
. O

" O
Now O
I O
wonder O
which O
I O
wore O
at O
that O
particular O
surgery O
? O

" O
" O
You O
are O
a O
fool O
, O
darling O
, O
" O
Di B-PERSON
said O
happily O
. O

" O
I O
shall O
take O
great O
pleasure O
in O
telling O
that O
young O
man O
exactly O
what O
you O
were O
doing O
that B-TIME
evening I-TIME
. O

" O
" O
No O
, O
don't O
, O
" O
he O
said O
, O
after O
kissing O
her O
again O
. O

" O
I O
rather O
like O
to O
have O
the O
housemen O
think O
of O
me O
as O
a O
two-timing B-CARDINAL
Don B-PERSON
Juan I-PERSON
. O

I O
'm O
such O
a O
dull O
fellow O
, O
really O
. O

" O
" O
Dull O
? O

" O
She O
couldn't O
believe O
it O
. O

Self-deprecation O
was O
not O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
Nigel's B-PERSON
usual O
attributes O
. O

" O
You O
need O
your O
holiday O
, O
darling O

I O
only O
wish O
I O
could O
go O
with O
you O

" O
" O
Doctor O
Wills B-PERSON
, O
if O
you O
're O
making O
improper O
suggestions O

? O

" O
" O
It O
would O
make O
me O
more O
interesting O

I O
suppose O
? O

" O
she O
enquired O
archly O
. O

" O
No O
, O
it O
wouldn't O
! O

" O
he O
almost O
snapped O
, O
surprising O
her O
. O

" O
You O
sounded O
like O
some- O
body O
else O
for O
a O
moment O
there O

It O
doesn't O

" O
" O
Nigel B-PERSON
- O
! O

" O
she O
gasped O
. O

" O
I O
didn't O
mean O
to O
behave O
like O
anything O
of O
the O
kind O

I O
was O
only O
joking O

" O
" O
Well O
, O
don't O

It O
's O
miserable O
enough O
my O
having O
to O
take O
my O
leave O
in O
the O
autumn B-TIME
without O
you O
trying O
to O
be O
bright O
and O
gay O
about O
it O

His O
mouth O
hardened O
, O
his O
eyes O
became O
steely O
. O

' O
I O
see O
. O

' O
Scorn O
lashed O
his O
words O

' O
I O
wonder O

him O

' O
' O
Nicholas B-PERSON
- O
' O
' O
Well O

At O

I O

the O
truth O

His O
gaze O
held O
hers O
masterfully O

' O
You O
wanted O
it O
so O
badly O

at O
any O
price O

I O
hope O
you O
are O
satisfied O

And O
as O
he O
spoke O

the O

lying O
in O
the O
other O
room O
filled O
him O
with O
a O
re- O
vulsion O
that O
was O
homicidal O
. O

Even O
in O
that O
, O
his O
hands O
were O
tied O
. O

He O
dare O
not O
precipitate O
what O
might O
well O
be O
another O
coronary O
. O

And O
in O
that B-TIME
second I-TIME
he O
put O
back O
his O
professional O
mantle O
, O
and O
said O
with O
such O
icy O
politeness O
, O
such O
withdrawn O
' O
I O
will O
leave O
you O
the O
necessary O
pre- O
scription O
for O
the O
sedatives O
. O

You O
will O
contact O
your O
new O
doctor O
when O
you O
reach O
your O
parents' O
house O
. O

' O
She O
watched O
him O
flick O
his O
fountain-pen O
from O
his O
waistcoat O
pocket O
, O
take O
out O
his O
 O
prescription O
pad O
, O
and O
 O
scribble O
on O
it O
. O

Then O
, O
with O
a O
gesture O
she O
knew O
so O
well O
, O
he O
tore O
off O
the O
leaflet O
and O
' O
Good-bye O
, O
Sandra B-PERSON
, O
' O
he O
said O
with O
a O
deadly O
finality O
. O

Watching O
him O
go O
, O
unable O
to O
speak O
, O
she O
felt O
that O
part O
of O
her O
was O
leaving O
him O
. O

She O
couldn't O
hate O
him O
... O
If O
only O
he O
would O
have O
con- O
fided O
in O
her O
, O
given O
some O
expla- O
nation O
. O

Now O
there O
was O
no- O
thing O
- O
not O
even O
friendship O
. O

She O
went O
back O
to O
Philip B-PERSON
. O

But O
all O
she O
could O
hear O
were O
Nicholas's B-PERSON
words O
: O
' O
I O
love O
you O
- O
oh O
, O
you O
know O
that O
well O
enough O
. O

' O
Love O
. O

She O
revolted O
against O
the O
word O
. O

Nicholas B-PERSON
, O
Philip B-PERSON
... O
where O
was O
happiness O
, O
or O
peace O
of O
mind O
? O

Philip B-PERSON
put O
out O
a O
hand O
and O
grasped O
hers O
. O

He O
needed O
her O
. O

She O
would O
find O
solace O
in O
that O
fact O
at O
least O
. O

She O
had O
her O
truth O
. O

How O
much O
had O
built O
up O
from O
that O
first B-CARDINAL
ideal O
, O
and O
how O
little O
joy O
, O
or O
satisfaction O
, O
it O
had O
given O
her O
. O

' O
I O
'm O
sorry O
, O
darling O
. O

' O
He O
looked O
nervous O
. O

It O
had O
been O
hell O
lying O
there O
, O
knowing O
she O
was O
talking O
to O
Nicholas B-PERSON
and O
wondering O
what O
they O
were O
saying O
. O

Sandra B-PERSON
said O
instinctively O
: O
' O
I O
told O
him O
I O
knew O
he O
was O
responsible O
for O
Beryl's B-PERSON
death O
. O

' O
Her O
eyes O
darkened O
in O
torment O
. O

' O
Are O
you O
sure O
that O
she O
was O
telling O
the O
truth O
? O

' O
' O
Good O
heavens O
, O
darling O
, O
why O
on O
earth O
should O
she O
lie O
? O

Besides O
, O
it O
wasn't O
just O
her O
word O
. O

There O
was O
enough O
evidence O
, O
no O
matter O
how O
one O
might O
want O
to O
disbelieve O
the O
facts O
. O

' O
Elation O
touched O
him O
after O
the O
cold O
wind O
of O
suspense O
. O

' O
It O
will O
be O
interesting O
to O
see O
what O
comes O
out O
at O
the O
inquest O
. O

What O
his O
story O
will O
be O
. O

I O
reckon O
he O
'll O
confine O
himself O
to O
the O
nervous O
origin O
of O
her O
recent O
illness O
. O

His O
notes O
will O
be O
truthful O
, O
but O
what O
he O
leaves O
out O
will O
matter O
most O
. O

' O
Strange O
how O
just O
then O
Philip B-PERSON
was O
so O
certain O
that O
Nicholas B-PERSON
would O
never O
betray O
him O
. O

He O
loved O
Sandra B-PERSON
too O
deeply O
to O
ruin O
her O
future O
happiness O
. O

Had O
ever O
circum- O
stances O
conspired O
so O
cunningly O
? O

Philip's B-PERSON
spirits O
soared O
. O

He O
was O
better O
; O
he O
had O
made O
a O
miraculous O
recovery O
and O
Sandra B-PERSON
would O
soon O
be O
his O
wife O
. O

The O
Devil B-PERSON
, O
he O
thought O
, O
certainly O
looked O
after O
his O
own O
. O

Something O
in O
Sandra's B-PERSON
attitude O
struck O
him O
suddenly O
, O
making O
him O
say O
: O
' O
You O
can't O
forgive O
him O
for O
this O
- O
can O
you O
? O

' O
' O
Forgive O
is O
an O
unctuous O
, O
patronizing O
word O
, O
' O
she O
replied O
. O

' O
I O
despise O
the O
deceit O
. O

The O
lies O
. O

' O
Philip B-PERSON
bristled O
. O

' O
It O
was O
never O
our O
intention O
to O
have O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
those O
carnival O
affairs O
, O
' O
he O
retorted O
and O
in O
that B-TIME
second I-TIME
, O
he O
became O
the O
man O
of O
success O
exerting O
authority O
. O

Sandra B-PERSON
watched O
her O
father's O
face O
pale O
. O

Philip B-PERSON
, O
she O
knew O
, O
got O
on O
his O
nerves O
, O
but O
everything O
had O
gone O
over O
her O
head O
. O

It O
didn't O
really O
matter O
what O
was O
being O
said O
because O
she O
was O
no O
longer O
a O
part O
of O
it O
. O

The O
thought O
of O
Nicholas B-PERSON
haunted O
her O
, O
the O
sense O
of O
loss O
crucifying O
. O

Her O
father's O
comment O
roused O
her O
as O
he O
said O
, O
' O
I O
was O
not O
talking O
of O
a O
carnival O
. O

But O
I O
presume O
we O
shall O
be O
allowed O
to O
have O
one B-CARDINAL
or O
two B-CARDINAL
of O
our O
friends O
at O
the O
ceremony O
. O

' O
His O
voice O
was O
like O
his O
black O
and O
pin-stripe O
, O
a O
grey O
superimposition O
of O
respectability O
over O
the O
original O
colour O
of O
his O
own O
natural O
vowels O
, O
the O
result O
being O
somehow O
as O
ineffective O
, O
not O
just O
dusty-grey O
but O
muddy O
, O
slimy O
even O
. O

His O
digressions O
too O
, O
seemed O
to O
have O
no O
other O
purpose O
than O
the O
throwing O
of O
dust O
in O
his O
client's O
eyes O
, O
the O
dust O
of O
fake O
security O
, O
of O
the O
fake O
friend O
of O
the O
family O
, O
like O
the O

of O

we O
'd O
have O
to O
have O
some O
sort O
of O
proof O
, O
you O
know O
, O
it O

very O
difficult O

a O
sober O
spot O

sly O
with O

and O
linked O
by O
a O
whispering O
plot O
of O
fountains O

In O
the O
main O
tree-heavy O
square O
you O
can O
sit O
in O
the O
autumn B-TIME
sunshine O
, O
still O
burning O
like O
a O
half-cooled B-CARDINAL
iron O
, O
sip O
pastis O
and O
read O
the O
local O
newspapers O
. O

One O
called O
La B-ORGANIZATION
Patriote I-ORGANIZATION
is O
Communist B-NORP
, O
and O
at O
the O
time O
of O
our O
arrival O
it O
was O
throwing O
huge O
over-ripe O
verbal O
tomatoes O
at O
General O
de B-PERSON
Gaulle I-PERSON
. O

One O
side O
of O
this O
square O
is O
a O
smart O
but O
modest O
bar O
called O
Pierre's B-ORGANIZATION
Bar I-ORGANIZATION
. O

For O
one B-TIME
day I-TIME
, O
with O
the O
help O
of O
the O
Syndicat B-ORGANIZATION
d'Initiative I-ORGANIZATION
, O
we O
had O
been O
hunting O
for O
furnished O
rooms O
, O
and O
had O
given O
up O
, O
when O
an O
elderly O
lady O
, O
the O
owner O
of O
a O
residence O
called O
the O
Poet's B-LOCATION
Nest I-LOCATION
, O
had O
firmly O
closed O
the O
door O
in O
our O
noses O
. O

' O
It O
is O
a O
pity O
, O
' O
said O
Mart B-PERSON
, O
' O
because O
it O
would O
have O
been O
a O
good O
address O
. O

' O
Now O
, O
after O
a O
woman's O
radar O
look O
, O
she O
decided O
Pierre B-PERSON
would O
solve O
our O
problems O
. O

This O
was O
true O
, O
Pierre B-PERSON
was O
a O
true O
Provenc*?6al O
, O
thin O
and O
yellow O
as O
lemon O
peel O
, O
wrestling O
with O
some O
gnawing O
rat O
of O
an O
illness O
, O
man O
of O
all O
trades O
, O
married O
to O
a O
commanding O
lady O
who O
loved O
small O
talk O
and O
the O
discreet O
accumulation O
of O
money O
. O

We O
went O
in O
. O

There O
were O
a O
few O
people O
in O
the O
bar O
, O
elderly O
, O
well-off O
, O
artistic O
, O
who O
, O
you O
felt O
, O
had O
made O
a O
hard O
bargain O
for O
giving O
up O
. O

' O
I O
have O
furnished O
rooms O
, O
' O
said O
Pierre B-PERSON
, O
' O
and O
all O
mod O
cons O
. O

' O
The O
price O
was O
16,000 B-CARDINAL
francs O
a B-TIME
month I-TIME
. O

' O
Yes O
, O
' O
we O
said O
immediately O
, O
even O
before O
viewing O
. O

We O
were O
shown O
around O
by O
Pierre B-PERSON
. O

The O
flat O
was O
on O
the O
third B-CARDINAL
floor O
; O
two O
rooms O
; O
soft O
Provenc*? O

good O

and O

; O
own O
private O
, O
modern O
lavatory O
. O

The O
first B-CARDINAL
night's B-TIME
sleeping O
was O
like O
a O
long O
convalescence O
. O

We O
were O
woken O
up O
twice O
about B-TIME
dawn I-TIME
by O
a O
soft O
eruption O
of O
turtle-doves O
. O

This O
was O
strange O
, O
even O
magic O
, O
because O
the O
owner's O
name O
was O
Pierre B-PERSON
Tortorolo I-PERSON
which O
, O
in O
Nicoison B-NORP
Italian I-NORP
means O
' O
turtledove O
' O
. O

Pierre B-PERSON
Turtledove I-PERSON
. O

When O
we O
woke O
up O
properly O
it O
was O
raining O
, O
an O
even O
more O
hopeless O
rain O
than O
London B-LOCATION
, O
and O
we O
looked O
out O
of O
the O
windows O
at O
the O
weeping O
trees O
and O
the O
curling O
white O
breath O
of O
the O
mountains O
. O

The O
land O
looked O
like O
a O
beaten O
woman O
and O
the O
turtle-doves O
cried O
her O
shame O
. O

There O
they O
were O
, O
in O
fact O
, O
below O
us O
, O
eight B-CARDINAL
of O
them O
. O

Four B-CARDINAL
of O
them O
were O
flattened O
on O
the O
window O
sills O
, O
two B-CARDINAL
immolated O
on O
a O
nearby O
roof O
top O
, O
the O
other O
pair O
copulating O
. O

We O
had O
a O
morning B-TIME
at O
Pierre's B-ORGANIZATION
. O

He O
talked O
about O
people O
. O

Marc B-PERSON
Chagall I-PERSON
used O
to O
live O
here O
and O
an O
Englishman B-NORP
named O
Lawrence B-PERSON
. O

He O
was O
here O
, O
near O
the O
railway O
station O
, O
three B-TIME
or I-TIME
four I-TIME
years I-TIME
. O

During O
this O
period O
he O
wrote O
a O
book O
, O
The O
Lover O
of O
Lady O
Chatterly B-PERSON
. O

It O
was O
growing O
cold O
. O

We O
left O
the O
crowd O
and O
drove O
back O
to O
Vence B-LOCATION
. O

The O
cool O
evening B-TIME
perfumes O
stood O
beckoning O
at O
the O
corners O
of O
the O
roads O
. O

Mart B-PERSON
is O
unable O
to O
smell O
( O
her O
sense O
organs O
were O
impaired O
years B-TIME
ago I-TIME
) O
, O
and O
I O
had O
to O
explain O
the O
low O
, O
sharp O
and O
sweet O
signals O
in O
the O
air O
. O

When O
we O
got O
back O
home O
we O
felt O
exhausted O
. O

London B-LOCATION
sickness O
( O
a O
sense O
of O
guilt O
, O
mingled O
with O
the O
memory O
of O
sandwiches O
We O
went O
straight O
to O
bed O
and O
slept O
until O
the O
turtle-doves O
drummed O
up O
the O
sun O
. O

The O
next B-TIME
morning I-TIME
, O
in O
the O
square O
opposite O
Pierre's B-ORGANIZATION
, O
I O
read O
about O
the O
Nice B-LOCATION
beach O
catastrophe O
in O
the O
Patriote B-ORGANIZATION
. O

Mart B-PERSON
had O
been O
right O
, O
the O
body O
had O
been O
a O
woman's O
. O

It O
belonged O
to O
a O
Madame O
N. B-PERSON
Enquiries I-PERSON
had O
been O
made O
in O
the O
neighbourhood O
, O
and O
it O
transpired O
that O
Madame O
N's B-PERSON
husband O
had O
made O
an O
arrangement O
with O
the O
dead O
lady's O
sister O
The O
sister O
, O
able O
to O
swim O
, O
had O
returned O
to O
the O
shore O
, O
but O
instead O
of O
returning O
to O
her O
brother-in-law O
( O
with O
whom O
she O
had O
an O
illicit O
relationship O
) O
, O
she O
went O
to O
her O
fiance*?2's O
house O
and O
confessed O
everything O
. O

Her O
fiance*?2 O
reported O
her O
to O
the O
police O
, O
and O
then O
jumped O
off O
a O
cliff O
near O
Monte B-LOCATION
Carlo I-LOCATION
. O

The O
day O
I O
promised O
to O
take O
Catherine B-PERSON
down O
to O
visit O
my O
young O
friend O
Philip B-PERSON
at O
his O
school O
in O
the O
country O
, O
we O
were O
to O
leave O
at O
eleven B-CARDINAL
, O
but O
she O
arrived O
at O
nine B-CARDINAL
. O

Her O
blue O
dress O
was O
new O
, O
and O
so O
were O
her O
fashionable O
shoes O
. O

Her O
hair O
had O
just O
been O
done O
. O

She O
looked O
more O
than O
ever O
like O
a O
pink O
and O
gold O
Renoir B-PERSON
girl O
who O
expects O
everything O
from O
life O
. O

Catherine B-PERSON
lives O
in O
a O
white O
house O
overlooking O
the O
sweeping O
brown O
tides O
of O
the O
river O
. O

She O
helped O
me O
clean O
up O
my O
flat O
with O
a O
devotion O
which O
said O
that O
she O
felt O
small O
flats O
were O
altogether O
more O
romantic O
than O
large O
houses O
. O

We O
drank O
tea O
, O
and O
talked O
mainly O
about O
Philip B-PERSON
, O
who O
, O
being O
15 B-TIME
, O
has O
pure O
stern O
tastes O
in O
every- O
thing O
from O
food O
to O
music O
. O

Catherine B-PERSON
looked O
at O
the O
books O
lying O
around O
his O
room O
, O
and O
asked O
if O
she O
might O
borrow O
the O
stories O
of O
Isaac B-PERSON
Babel I-PERSON
to O
read O
on O
the O
train O
. O

Catherine B-PERSON
is O
13 B-TIME
. O

I O
suggested O
she O
might O
find O
them O
dif- O
ficult O
, O
but O
she O
said O
, O
' O
Philip B-PERSON
reads O
them O
, O
doesn't O
he O
? O

' O
During O
the O
journey O
I O
read O
newspapers O
and O
watched O
her O
pretty O
frowning O
face O
as O
she O
turned O
the O
pages O
of O
Babel B-PERSON
, O
for O
she O
was O
determined O
to O
let O
nothing O
get O
between O
her O
and O
At O
the O
school O
, O
which O
is O
charming O
, O
ci- O
vilised O
and O
expensive O
, O
the O
two B-CARDINAL
children O
walked O
together O
across O
green O
fields O
, O
and O
I O
followed O
, O
seeing O
how O
the O
sun O
gilded O
their O
bright O
friendly O
heads O
turned O
towards O
each O
other O
as O
they O
talked O
. O

In O
Catherine's B-PERSON
left O
hand O
she O
carried O
the O
stories O
of O
Isaac B-PERSON
Babel I-PERSON
. O

After O
lunch O
we O
went O
to O
the O
pictures O
. O

Philip B-PERSON
allowed O
 O
it O
to O
be O
seen O
that O
he O
thought O
going O
to O
the O
pictures O
just O
for O
the O
fun O
of O
it O
was O
For O
his O
sake O
we O
chose O
the O
more O
serious O
of O
the O
two B-CARDINAL
films O
that O
were O
showing O
in O
the O
little O
town O
. O

It O
was O
about O
a O
good O
priest O
who O
helped O
cri- O
minals O
in O
New B-LOCATION
York I-LOCATION
. O

His O
goodness O
, O
how- O
ever O
, O
was O
not O
enough O
to O
prevent O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
them O
from O
being O
sent O
to O
the O
gas O
chamber O
; O
and O
Philip B-PERSON
and O
I O
waited O
with O
Catherine B-PERSON
in O
the O
dark O
until O
she O
had O
stopped O
crying O
and O
could O
face O
the O
light O
of O
a O
golden O
evening B-TIME
. O

At O
the O
entrance O
of O
the O
cinema O
the O
doorman O
was O
lying O
in O
wait O
for O
anyone O
who O
had O
red O
eyes O
. O

Grasping O
Catherine B-PERSON
by O
her O
suffering O
arm O
, O
he O
said O
bitterly O
: O
' O
Yes O
, O
why O
are O
you O
crying O
, O
he O
had O
to O
be O
punished O
for O
his O
crime O
, O
didn't O
he O
? O

' O
Cathe- B-PERSON
rine I-PERSON
stared O
at O
him O
, O
incredulous O
. O

Philip B-PERSON
rescued O
her O
by O
saying O
with O
disdain O
: O
' O
Some O
people O
don't O
know O
right O
from O
wrong O
even O
when O
its O
demonstrated O
to O
them O
. O

' O
The O
doorman O
turned O
his O
attention O
to O
the O
next O
red-eyed O
emerger O
from O
the O
dark O
; O
and O
we O
went O
on O
together O
to O
the O
station O
, O
the O
children O
silent O
because O
of O
the O
cruelty O
of O
the O
world O
. O

Finally O
Catherine B-PERSON
said O
, O
her O
eyes O
wet O
again O
: O
' O
I O
think O
its O
all O
absolutely O
beastly O
, O
and O
I O
can't O
bear O
to O
think O
about O
it O
. O

' O
And O
Philip B-PERSON
said O
: O
' O
But O
we O
've O
got O
to O
think O
about O
it O
, O
don't O
you O
see O
, O
because O
if O
we O
don't O
it O
'll O
just O
go O
on O
and O
on O
, O
don't O
you O
see O
? O

' O
In O
the O
train O
going O
back O
to O
London B-LOCATION
I O
sat O
beside O
 O
Catherine B-PERSON
. O

She O
had O
the O
stories O
open O
in O
front O
of O
her O
, O
but O
she O
said O
: O
' O
Philip B-PERSON
's O
awfully O
lucky O
. O

I O
wish O
I O
went O
to O
that O
school O
. O

Did O
you O
notice O
that O
girl O
who O
said O
hullo O
to O
him O
in O
the O
garden O
? O
