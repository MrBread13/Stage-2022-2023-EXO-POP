Mr. O

at O

reason O

on O
the O
basis O
of O
the O
information O
it O

so O

that O
such O

The O

however O
, O
that O
the O

already O

A O
lesser O
obstacle O

the O
absence O

is O
confident O
the O

While O
the O
possibility O

an O

entirely O
discounted O

he O

agree O
that O
the O
point O

been O
reached O
National O

ever O
resorted O

engagement O

probably O
have O
to O

THE O
Prime O

disclosed O
in O
the O

last B-TIME

he O
had O
considered O

bring O
the O
British B-ORG
Army I-ORG
of I-ORG
the I-ORG
Rhine I-ORG
on O
to O
a O
war O
footing O
. O

He O
decided O
that O
it O
would O
be O
a O
great O
error O
there O
would O
be O
no O
hesitation O
in O
mobilising O
if O
a O
further O
deterioration O
in O
the O
situation O
warranted O
such O
a O
step O
. O

It O
would O
have O
to O
be O
accompanied O
by O
other O
measures O
of O
a O
military O
, O
economic O
and O
political O
kind O
. O

Mr. O
Macmillan B-PER
, O
who O
was O
winding O
up O
the O
foreign O
affairs O
debate O
, O
said O
the O
Government B-ORG
could O
not O
be O
party O
to O
accepting O
as O
a O
matter O
of O

the O
imposed O
division O
of O

" O
We O

not O

we O
must O
not O

I O

" O
Mr. O
Godber B-PER
, O
Minister O
of O
State O
, O
Foreign B-ORG
Office I-ORG
, O
said O
earlier O
that O
the O
Government B-ORG
had O
asked O
the O
Medical B-ORG

Council I-ORG
to O
reassess O
the O
fall-out O
position O

The O
Council's B-ORG
findings O
would O
be O

public O

a O
vigour O
and O
authority O
which O
delighted O
the O
Earl O

Avon B-GPE

the O
former O
Sir O
Anthony B-PER
that O
 O
appeasement O
over O
Berlin B-GPE

only O

he O
the O

it O

It O
was O
the O

rather O
curious O
speech O
in O
which O
Mr. O
Macmillan B-PER
wound O
up O
the O
two-day B-DATE

He O
began O
in O
a O
low O
, O
almost O
chatty O
mono- O
tone O
, O
and O
his O
voice O
never O
rose O
to O
any O
accent O
of O
urgency O
. O

He O
passed O
in O
rapid O
nuclear O
tests O
; O
the O
canard O
about O
British B-NORP
interference O
with O
the O
United B-ORG
Nations I-ORG
in O
the O
Congo B-GPE
; O
Kuwait B-GPE
; O
and O
South-East B-LOCATION
Asia I-LOCATION
. O

He O
spent O
most O
of O
his O
short O
half-hour B-TIME
on O
Berlin B-GPE
. O

He O
deplored O
the O
possibility O
of O

" O
about O

what O
the O
Russians B-NORP
want O

" O
But O
he O
was O
certain O
that O
they O
wanted O
to O
establish O
a O
final O
and O
irrevocable O
division O
of O
Germany B-GPE
. O

Britain B-GPE
could O
not O
be O
a O

the O

had O

could O

thought O

the O
situation O
was O
rather O
more O
hopeful O

The O
Russians B-NORP
now O
realised O
its O
seriousness O

The O
French B-NORP
doubts O
were O
more O
about O

than O
about O

The O
Prime O
Minister's O
attitude O
of O
studied O
calm O
brought O
down O
the O
temperature O
of O
the O
debate O
, O
which O
never O
at O
any O
time O
rose O
to O
fever O
pitch O
, O
to O
a O
remarkable O
degree O
of O
sub-normality O

Throughout O
Mr. O
Macmillan's B-PER
speech O
the O
Earl O
of O
Home B-PER
, O
Foreign O
Secretary O
, O
was O
listening O
in O
the O
Peers' B-FAC
Gallery I-FAC

The O
early O
speakers O
in O
the O
debate O
each O
severely O
rated O
the O
speech O
of O
his O
predecessor O

These O
strictures O
were O
all O
too O
well O
justified O
. O

We O
started O
with O
the O
plaintive O
wailings O
of O
Mr. O
Healey B-PER
, O
" O
Shadow O

Foreign O
Secretary O
, O
described O
by O
Mr. O
Godber B-PER

Minister O

, O
as O
" O
pedantic O

for O
having O
read O
the O
The O
trouble O
about O
such O
debates O
is O
that O
they O
range O
too O
widely O
. O

They O
remind O
one O
of O
the O
Rugby O
match O
in O
" O
Tom B-WORK_OF_ART
Brown's I-WORK_OF_ART
Schooldays I-WORK_OF_ART
, O
" O
in O
which O
all O
the O

were O
welcome O
to O
take O
part O

and O
only O
those O
who O
" O
really O
meant O

" O
removed O
their O

Not O
many O
metaphorical O
braces O
were O
visible O
in O
the O
Healey B-PER
had O
another O
tilt O
at O
the O
Prime O
Minister's O
golf-course O
Press O
conference O
, O
which O
he O
described O
as O
" O
a O
display O
of O
flabby O
and O
A O
reference O
to O
the O
reunification O
of O
Germany B-GPE
brought O

. O

Then O
Mr. O
Healey B-PER
launched O
out O
on O
his O
pet O
theme O
of O
limitation O
of O
armaments O
in O
Europe B-LOCATION
. O

This O
could O
, O
he O
suggested O
, O
be O
linked O
with O
prohibition O
of O
the O
production O
of O
atomic O
weapons O
in O
any O
part O
of O
Europe B-LOCATION
. O

Inspection O
and O
control O
would O
be O
much O
easier O
to O
Mr. O
Healey B-PER
denounced O
the O
Government B-ORG
for O
using O
double O
standards O
. O

Ministers O
had O
rebuked O
the O
unaligned O
nations O
for O
not O
they O
themselves O
had O
no O
condemnation O
for O
events O
in O
Angola B-GPE
or O
Algeria B-GPE
. O

It O
was O
not O
for O
the O
Government B-ORG
, O
said O
Mr. O
Healey B-PER
, O
to O
take O
up O
moral O
attitudes O
, O
" O
especially O
when O
the O
temple O
of O
their O
religion O
is O
the O
bingo-parlour O

" O
This O
puzzled O
such O
students O
of O
comparative O
religion O
as O
had O
failed O
to O
detect O
this O
cult O
. O

But O
Mr. O
Healey B-PER
had O
a O
partial O
and O
limited O
success O
. O

He O
rallied O
behind O
him O
night B-TIME
by O
his O
leader O
, O
Mr. O
Gaitskell B-PER
. O

Mr. O
Godber's B-PER
performance O
merited O
all O
the O
mild O
scorn O
heaped O
on O
it O
by O
Mr. O
Shinwell B-PER
. O

True O
, O
he O
did O
tell O
the O
House B-ORG
that O
the O
Government B-ORG
had O
asked O
the O
Medical B-ORG
Research I-ORG
Council I-ORG
to O
reassess O
the O
fall-out O
position O
in O
the O
council's B-ORG
findings O
would O
be O
published O
. O

He O
was O
not O
so O
happy O
in O
his O
defence O
of O
the O
Government's B-ORG
failure O
to O
condemn O
France B-GPE
for O
her O
nuclear O
tests O
in O
the O
Sahara B-LOCATION
on O
the O
grounds O
that O
they O
were O
only O
little O
ones O
. O

This O
was O
too O
reminiscent O
of O
the O
nursemaid O
and O
her O
illegitimate O
baby O
. O

For O
the O
most O
part O
, O
Mr. O
Godber B-PER
muttered O
his O
way O
through O
a O
cliche-ridden O
Foreign B-ORG
Office I-ORG
brief O
. O

He O
resembles O
the O

an O
 O
otherwise O
endearing O

This O
apparently O
, O
was O
Mr. O
Macmillan's B-PER
assessment O

He O
confined O
his O
reply O
to O
the O
observation O
that O
Mr. O

had O
probably O
" O
maximised O
his O
support O

" O
There O
were O
no O

But O
there O
was O
ample O

Conservative B-ORG

opposition O

which O
will O
be O
aired O
in O
the O

He O

Mr. O

for O
the O

the O

Will O
it O
end O
with O
South B-GPE
Africa's I-GPE
exclusion O
from O
the O
Commonwealth B-ORG

The O
issue O
is O
touch O

There O
is O
a O
possibility O
that O
it O
will O
not O
be O
settled O
at O
this O

It O
may O
be O
agreed O
to O
wait O
until O
South B-GPE
Africa I-GPE
actually O

a O

But O
if O
a O

decision O

on O
which O
side O
do O
the O
strongest O

? O

THE O
Archbishop O
of O
Capetown B-GPE
has O
shown O
that O
the O

not O
clear-cut O

The O
Archbishop O
has O
long O
been O
a O
courageous O
fighter O
against O
apartheid O
. O

He O
must O
be O
heard O
with O
attention O
. O

On O
purely O
practical O
grounds O
he O
holds O
that O
it O
would O
be O
a O
mistake O
to O
expel O
South B-GPE
Africa I-GPE
, O
weakening O
the O
whites O
who O
are O
working O

a O
change O

In O
his O
view O
it O
would O
also O

A O
CURIOUS O
advertisement O

Those O
who O
lend O
their O
names O
to O
this O
kind O
of O
advertisement O
are O
worthy O
people O
, O
a O
little O
innocent O
of O
politics O
, O
perhaps O
, O
or O
carried O
away O
by O
the O
idea O
that O
moral O
regeneration O
would O
solve O
all O
our O
problems O

So O
it O
would O
. O

While O
we O
are O
waiting O
for O
the O
millenium B-DATE
, O
however O
, O
most O
of O
us O
would O
prefer O
to O
put O
our O
hopes O
for O
earthly O
justice O
in O
instruments O
of O
democracy O
, O
such O
as O
trade O
unions O
and O
our O
local O
and O
national O
Parliaments B-ORG

Should O
the O
Herald B-ORG
publish O
such O
advertisements O
? O

This O
is O
a O
difficult O
question O
. O

It O
would O
obviously O
be O
wrong O
to O
refuse O
all O
political O
advertisements O
with O
contains O
statements O
whose O
factual O
truth O
is O
doubtful O
, O
or O
where O
the O
total O
content O
would O
be O
deeply O
repugnant O
to O
our O
readers O
, O
it O
is O
right O
to O
exercise O
editorial O
discretion O
. O

The O
MRA B-ORG
advertisement O
falls O
into O
neither O
category O
, O
though O
many O
readers O
will O
dislike O
it O
. O

The O
first B-ORDINAL
reaction O
of O
the O
Sudanese B-ORG
Government I-ORG
was O
to O
denounce O
the O
United B-ORG
to O
say O
that O
its O
400 B-CARDINAL
troops O
in O
the O
Congo B-GPE
would O
be O
taken O
home O

The O
reaction O
can O
be O
understood O
. O

The O
Sudan's B-GPE
concern O
for O
its O
men O
is O
natural O
. O

But O
this O
could O
hardly O
be O
a O
 O
dignified O
exit O
. O

IF O
the O
UN B-ORG
is O
blamed O
for O
being O
weak O
, O
it O
would O
be O
more O
logical O
to O
send O
in O
more O
men O
, O
not O
weaken O
it O
further O
by O
desertion O
. O

It O
is O
unjust O
to O
pass O
the O
buck O
to O
Mr. O
Hammarskjold B-PER
and O
the O
UN's B-ORG
servants O
. O

The O
responsibility O
rightly O
belongs O
to O
the O
nations O
which O
have O
undertaken O
the O
task O
of O
pre- O
serving O
peace O
in O
the O
Congo B-GPE
. O

That O
is O
not O
a O
ceremonial O
duty O
, O
and O
the O
soldiers O
have O
every O
right O
to O
blame O
the O
politicians O
unless O
they O
see O
it O
through O
. O

When O
the O
United B-ORG
Nations I-ORG
instructed O
Mr. O
Hammarskjold B-PER
to O
use O
force O
if O
necessary O
to O
prevent O
civil O
war O
, O
it O
was O
clear O
that O
new O
dangers O
would O
arise O
unless O
it O
gave O
him O

was O
the O
first B-ORDINAL

who O
must O
take O

If O
the O
UN B-ORG
forces O
were O
thick O
enough O
on O
the O
ground O

happen O

THE O
UN's B-ORG
ability O
to O
keep O
peace O
depends O
simply O
on O
adequate O
support O
by O
the O
nations O
which O
have O
set O
their O
hands O
to O
this O
plough O

The O
big O
Powers O
involved O
in O
the O
Cold B-EVENT
War I-EVENT
must O
of O
course O
keep O
out O

The O
Americans B-NORP
were O
justified O
in O
diverting O
naval O
ships O
in O
case O
stressed O
that O
there O
was O
no O
intention O

Yesterday B-DATE
the O

Belgium B-GPE

HOUNDING O
Belgium B-GPE

Why O
? O

Because O
those O

said O
the O

govern O

they O

Not O

The O
appalling O
thing O
about O
the O
Germans B-NORP
is O
that O
they O
can O
kid O
them- O
selves O
and O
feel O
a O
sense O

righteousness O
when O
their O

" O
Without O
Britain's B-GPE
tolerance O
German B-NORP
rearma- O

At O

by O

the O

Herr O
Strauss B-PER
told O
the O

last B-DATE

that O
his O

to O
make O

the O

" O
The O
process O

When O
Scarborough B-GPE
carried O
our O
point O
of O
view O
we O
were O
naturally O
delighted O
, O
more O
so O
because O
the O
alternatives O
had O
been O
put O
clearly O
to O
the O
movement O
, O
which O
had O
then O
chosen O
a O
vigorous O
anti-Nato B-NORP
, O
anti-Tory B-NORP
, O
anti-bomb B-NORP
and O
anti-German B-NORP
rearmament O
policy O
. O

Hopes O
rose O
as O
we O
saw O
a O
perspective O
of O
sharp O
struggle O
based O
on O
consistent O
lines O
of O
difference O
with O
the O
Tories B-NORP
. O

Many O
members O
understood O
that O
the O
bread-and-butter O
struggles O
of O
the O
union O
would O
become O
easier O
in O
the O
context O
They O
obstructed O
every O
effort O
to O
fight O
for O
the O
Scarborough B-GPE
decisions O
, O
while O
 O
scratching O
around O
frantically O
to O
overturn O
them O

never O

which O
is O
the O

as O
that O
of O

to O

She O
thrust O
out O
her O
hand O

and O
felt O
emptiness O
. O

A B-TIME
FEW I-TIME
minutes I-TIME
later I-TIME
the O
father O
gripping O
a O
loaded O
rifle O
, O
told O
his O
wife O
: O
Against O
these O
advantages O
the O
codex O
was O
fragile O
and O
might O
be O
bulky O
. O

It O
is O
sometimes O
possible O
to O
tell O
whether O
or O
not O
a O
particular O
text O
was O
written O
on O
a O
roll O
or O
a O
codex O
. O

Rolls O
were O
prepared O
for O
writing O
, O
but O
any O
papyrus O
left O
unused O
at O
the O
end O
could O
be O
cut O
off O
. O

If O
the O
text O
was O
longer O
than O
the O
roll O
, O
a O
sheet O
could O
easily O
be O
glued O
on O
. O

The O
verso O
of O
the O
roll O
was O
blank O
, O
and O
one O
cannot O
think O
of O
an O
author O
, O
Mark B-PER
for O
example O
, O
sending O
out O
his O
Gospel B-WORK_OF_ART
lacking O
the O
ending O
, O
while O
one O
whole O
side O
of O
his O
roll O
was O
unused O
. O

The O
codex O
form O
was O
not O
so O
accommodating O
. O

Even O
in O
the O
case O
of O
the O
single-sheet O
quire O
, O
an O
extra O
sheet O
glued O
on O
might O
have O
to O
be O
gummed O
on O
over O
the O
binding O
, O
or O
the O
whole O
codex O
rebound O
. O

According O
to O
the O
legend O
, O
Solomon B-PER
had O
asked O
the O
the O
Shamir O
and O
Ashmodeus B-PER
told O
him O
that O
the O
Shamir O
had O
not O
been O
placed O
under O
his O
charge O
, O
as O
brought O
the O
Shamir O
to O
Solomon B-PER
from O
Eden B-LOCATION
, O
the O
Paradise B-LOCATION
, O
the O
only O
place O
where O
the O
Shamir O
could O
be O
found O
. O

The O
Talmud B-WORK_OF_ART
describes O
that O
the O
Shamir O
lives O
in O
a O
sanctuary O
, O
and O
only O
some O
rare O
birds O
know O
the O
existence O
of O
it O
. O

These O
birds O
are O
, O
the O
Cherubim O
and O
the O
Seraphim O
. O

We O
are O
also O
told O
that O
the O
Shamir O
is O
the O
stylus O
used O
by O
Moses B-PER
, O
and O
this O
stylus O
is O
described O
as O
a O
very O
precious O
diamond-stone O
and O
very O
adamant O
. O

And O
you O
serve O
Mammon O
and O
God O
. O

And O
you O
cannot O

The B-DATE
new I-DATE
century I-DATE
opened O
with O
James B-PER
1 I-PER
ascending O
the O
throne O
. O

He O
was O
quite O
prepared O
to O
be O
tolerant O
towards O
Rome B-GPE
though O
the O
Gunpowder B-EVENT
Plot I-EVENT
spoiled O
that O
. O

The O
Puritans B-NORP
had O
high O
hopes O
, O
for O
James B-PER
had O
grown O
up O
in O
Presbyterian B-NORP
Scotland B-GPE
, O
but O
those O
hopes O
were O
dashed O
. O

True O
, O
a O
new O
Prayer B-WORK_OF_ART
Book I-WORK_OF_ART
was O
issued O
in O
1604 B-DATE
but O
the O
Puritans B-NORP
derived O
little O
comfort O
from O
it O
. O

This O
indicated O
how O
ephemeral O
in O
the O
Church B-ORG
had O
been O
the O
mood O
which O
produced O
the O
Black O
Rubric O
, O
for O
it O
says O
that O
' O
the O
Body O
and O
Blood O
of O
Christ B-PER
, O
which O
are O
definite O
. O

It O
was O
at O
this O
time O
, O
too O
, O
that O
King O
James B-PER
made O
a O
Bible B-WORK_OF_ART
translation O
- O
the O
Authorized O
Version O
In O
that O
year O
Shakespeare B-PER
had O
just O
turned O
forty B-DATE
and O
had O
written O
Hamlet B-WORK_OF_ART
two B-DATE
years I-DATE
before I-DATE
. O

Bacon B-PER
was O
at O
work O
and O
Milton B-PER
was O
just O
learning O
to O
read O
. O

James B-PER
was O
followed O
by O
Charles B-PER
, O
in O
whose O
reign O
came O
the O
Scottish B-WORK_OF_ART
Prayer I-WORK_OF_ART
Book I-WORK_OF_ART
in O
1637 B-DATE
. O

Significantly O
this O
made O
a O
deliberate O
return O
to O
the O
Book B-WORK_OF_ART
of O
1549 B-DATE
and O
became O
the O
foster O
mother O
of O
some O
of O
the O
most O
important O
Prayer O
Books O
in O
the O
Anglican B-ORG
Communion I-ORG
. O

Forever O
associated O
with O
Charles B-PER
is O
Archbishop O
Laud B-PER
, O
now O
so O
much O
nobler O
a O
figure O
than O
former O
historians O
led O
us O
to O
believe O
. O

Laud B-PER
was O
enthusiastically O
hated O
by O
Calvinists B-NORP
and O
Puritans B-NORP
, O
and O
the O
sentiment O
was O
mutual O
. O

But O
Laud B-PER
was O
no O
Romanizer O
. O

One B-CARDINAL
of O
his O
first B-ORDINAL
public O
acts O
was O
a O
hard-hitting O
battle O
with O
the O
Jesuit B-NORP
, O
Fisher B-PER
. O

But O
anyone O
who O
was O
friendly O
with O
James B-PER
and O
Charles B-PER
, O
the O
Puritans B-NORP
argued O
, O
was O
necessarily O
a O
menace O
. O

In O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
place O
it O
is O
not O
a O
great O
deal O
of O
use O
telling O
even O
children O
, O
as O
I O
have O
already O
suggested O
, O
not O
to O
be O
silly O
or O
to O
pull O
themselves O
together O
. O

Far O
better O
to O
help O
them O
to O
face O
whatever O
it O
is O
that O
is O
worrying O
them O
, O
to O
find O
the O
original O
cause O
and O
then O
deal O
with O
it O
; O
show O
it O
up O
either O
for O
the O
sham O
it O
is O
- O
and O
many O
fears O
are O
based O
upon O
completely O
irrational O
pre-conceived O
notions O
- O
or O
to O
Even O
worse O
is O
to O
laugh O
. O

Tremendous O
damage O
may O
be O
done O
to O
a O
child O
by O
laughing O
at O
what O
are O
very O
real O
fears O
. O

As O
adults O
, O
we O
know O
that O
their O
fears O
are O
groundless O
, O
indeed O
to O
us O
they O
appear O
laughable O
, O
but O
to O
a O
child O
they O
are O
very O
real O
. O

Not O
that O
I O
am O
suggesting O
that O
children O
should O
be O
molly-coddled O
- O
they O
must O
be O
made O
to O
face O
their O
fears O
, O
to O
see O
through O
them O
and O
come O
out O
on O
the O
other O
side O
as O
victors O
. O

Because O
situations O
which O
may O
contain O
all O
the O
elements O
of O
fear O
can O
arise O
suddenly O
, O
it O
is O
a O
good O
idea O
to O
condition O
a O
child O
to O
some O
extent O
against O
it O
. O

To O
keep O
a O
child O
of O
twelve B-CARDINAL
or O
thirteen B-CARDINAL
under O
the O
impression O
that O
nothing O
nasty O
ever O
happens O
is O
not O
merely O
dishonest O
, O
it O
is O
unwise O
. O

As O
I O
shall O
suggest O
in O
a O
later O
chapter O
there O
are O
some O
situations O
which O
occur O
less O
frequently O
than O
Was O
this O
: O
That O
a O
secret O
plan O
Is O
hid O
in O
Because O
of O
the O
plan O
That O
God O
, O
Who O
dwells O
in O
my O
hand O
, O
Knows O
this O
secret O
plan O
, O
Of O
the O
things O
He O
will O
do O
for O
the O

Loving O
Saviour O
, O
who O
experienced O
all O
human O
emotion O
, O
and O
whose O
sensitive O
nature O
knows O
better O
than O
we O
do O
, O
what O
it O
is O
to O
be O
really O
afraid O
, O
help O
us O
to O
know O
that O
when O
we O
face O
life O
boldly O
, O
many O
of O
the O
shadows O
are O
come O
what O
may O
, O
we O
are O
never O
alone O
when O
we O
are O
with O
Thee O
. O

To O
others O
, O
the O
long O
hours O
of O
the O
night B-TIME
bring O
only O
a O
disturbed O
tossing O
and O
turning O
which O
causes O
them O
to O
wake O
feeling O
worse O
than O
when O
they O
went O
to O
bed O
. O

We O
may O
begin O
to O
understand O
this O
a O
little O
better O
when O
we O
realize O
that O
tiredness O
itself O
is O
largely O
in O
the O
mind O
. O

Very O
few O
people O
, O
under O
normal O
conditions O
, O
work O
themselves O
to O
a O
standstill O
. O

The O
mind O
tires O
first B-ORDINAL
and O
conveys O
the O
impression O
of O
tiredness O
to O
the O
body O
. O

This O
can O
be O
proved O
by O
noting O
the O
effect O
of O
a O
new O
stimulus O
on O
some- O
body O
who O
feels O
thoroughly O
tired O
. O

Suppose O
a O
mother O
has O
news O
late B-TIME
at I-TIME
night I-TIME
that O
her O
child O
is O
in O
danger O
. O

She O
will O
undertake O
a O
journey O
which O
, O
an B-TIME
hour I-TIME
before O
, O
she O
would O
have O
declared O
impossible O
. O

a O
burden O
to O
their O
families O
and O
their O
friends O
. O

Any O
mental O
confusion O
can O
cause O
this O
and O
the O
best O
way O
is O
probably O
to O
seek O
advice O
. O

As O
we O
are O
unable O
to O
cure O
our O
own O
bodies O
if O
the O
cause O
of O
our O
pain O
is O
too O
deep O
seated O
, O
so O
we O
are O
unable O
to O
cure O
our O
own O
minds O
, O
involving O
careful O
and O
patient O
treatment O
. O

One B-CARDINAL
of O
the O
greatest O
steps O
forward O
that O
has O
been O
made O
this B-DATE
century I-DATE
is O
the O
way O
in O
which O
illness O
of O
the O
mind O
is O
no O
longer O
feared O
or O
shunned O
, O
and O
is O
in O
fact O
no O
differently O
regarded O
than O
physical O
illness O
. O

There O
is O
, O
nevertheless O
, O
a O
great O
deal O
of O
tiredness O
which O
comes O
from O
no O
major O
complication O
but O
results O
from O
an O
inability O
to O
deal O
with O
life O
, O
especially O
under O
the O
diverse O
pattern O
which O
is O
the B-DATE
twentieth I-DATE
century I-DATE
. O

individual O
has O
become O
so O
complex O
that O
it O
taxes O
the O
mind O

Now O
a O

may O

from O
his O

The O
only O
connexion O
is O
the O
pipeline O
of O
the O
railway O
on O
which O
they O
travel O
day O
by O
day O
. O

their O
place O
of O
work O
and O
their O
associates O
at O
are O
possibly O
like O
in O
the O
surroundings O
of O
their O
homes O
. O

It O
is O
easy O
, O
desperately O
easy O
, O
to O
lead O
a O
' O
double O
' O
life O
without O
ever O
deliberately O
planning O
to O
do O
so O
or O
in O
fact O
being O
conscious O
of O
what O
is O
going O
on O
. O

It O
is O
easier O
to O
live O
life O
in O
compartments O
but O
over O
the O
years O
it O
builds O
up O
, O
and O
to O
do O
so O
inevitably O
builds O
up O
tensions O
which O
Can O
we O
then O
frame O
some O
' O
rules O
' O
which O
may O
enable O
us O
to O
live O
life O
as O
fully O
as O
possible O
, O
without O
having O
our O
energy O
sapped O
by O
un- O
We O
have O
a O
saying O
' O
My O
head O
will O
never O
save O
my O
feet O
' O
. O

Time O
after O
time O
we O
forget O
something O
and O
have O
to O
go O
back O
upstairs O
or O
down O
to O
the O
shops O
. O

The O
housewife O
would O
find O
life O
far O
less O
tiring O
if O
she O
made O
a O
list O
, O
followed O
a O
routine O
of O
work O
rather O
than O
getting O
from O
one O
thing O
to O
the O
next O
. O

The O
business O
man O
would O
find O
that O
he O
reached O
the B-DATE
end I-DATE
of I-DATE
the I-DATE
day I-DATE
with O
far O
less O
strain O
if O
he O
was O
a O
little O
more O
systematic O
. O

To O
drift O
aimlessly O
along O
is O
more O
wearying O
than O
any- O
thing O
else O
. O

If O
we O
would O
only O
sit O
down O
and O
write O
out O
all O
the O
necessary O
jobs O
waiting O
to O
be O
done O
and O
then O
work O
quietly O
through O
them O
, O
we O
would O
find O
life O
considerably O
less O
exhausting O
There O
may O
be O
some O
who O
will O
argue O
that O
routine O
destroys O
the O
soul O
. O

It O
is O
so O
easy O
, O
they O
say O
, O
to O
get O
into O
a O
rut O
. O

Save O
us O
from O
the O
school O
curriculum O
and O
even O
worse O
the O
school O
system O
whereby O
for O
meals O
everybody O
knows O
beforehand O
exactly O
what O
, O
on O
any O
given O
day O
of O
the O
week O
, O
they O
are O
going O
to O
have O
. O

If O
- O
such O
a O
critic O
may O
say O
- O
you O
are O
calling O
us O
to O
adventure O
, O
do O
not O
strangle O
us O
before O
I O
am O
more O
than O
conscious O
of O
this O
. O

How O
anybody O
can O
go O
through O
the O
same O
routine O
day O
in O
and O
day O
out O
for O
forty B-DATE
years I-DATE
I O
find O
difficult O
to O
understand O
. O

A O
lot O
of O
it O
is O
inevitable O
so O
that O
industry O
and O
commerce O
may O
be O
kept O
going O
- O
though O
if O
ever O
it O
becomes O
possible O
to O
work O
out O
a O
system O
of O
' O
staggered O
' O
hours O
it O
may O
do O
an O
immense O
amount O
of O
good O
over O
and O
above O
relieving O
As O
it O
is O
, O
with O
so O
much O
of O
our O
life O
already O
in O
a O
predetermined O
groove O
, O
I O
would O
hardly O
like O
to O
add O
further O
to O
the O
dullness O
for O
this O
. O

I O
know O
how O
much O
of O
a O
drag O
it O
can O
be O
and O
I O
was O
interested O
some O
little O
while O
ago O
to O
hear O
of O
a O
school O
who O
tried O
a O
six- B-DATE
day I-DATE
timetable O
. O

They O
only O
worked O
, O
of O
course O
, O
a B-DATE
five- I-DATE
day I-DATE
week I-DATE
so O
that O
in O
the B-DATE
first I-DATE
week I-DATE
Monday I-DATE
to I-DATE
Friday I-DATE
were O
days O
one B-CARDINAL
to O
five B-CARDINAL
of O
the O
timetable O
, O
the B-DATE
following I-DATE
Monday I-DATE
was O
day B-DATE
six I-DATE
and O
Tuesday B-DATE
started O
day B-DATE
one I-DATE
again O
and O
so O
on O
. O

By O
this O
means O
they O
avoided O
each B-DATE
week I-DATE
being O
the O
same O
with O
a O
pupil O
knowing O
exactly O
what O
the O
subject O
would O
be O
on O
Friday B-DATE
afternoon B-TIME
at O
3 B-TIME
p.m. I-TIME
. O

It O
was O
a O
little O
complicated O
to O
work O
, O
notice O
in O
the O
entrance O
saying O
which O
day O
of O
the O
timetable O
it O
was O
- O
but O
and O
kept O
everybody O
on O
their O
toes O
. O

To O
have O
order O
does O
not O
mean O
getting O
into O
a O
dull O
routine O
. O

I O
have O
great O
sympathy O
with O
the O
young O
wife O
who O
does O
not O
always O
want O
to O
do O
I O
would O
not O
want O
to O
either O
, O
but O
if O
she O
wants O
to O
get O
through O
sit O
down O
quietly O
and O
make O
a O
list O
of O
everything O
she O
has O
got O
to O
do O
, O
note O
the O
order O
in O
which O
they O
can O
most O
conveniently O
be O
done O
( O
or O
must O
be O
done O
because O
of O
other O
predetermined O
factors O
- O
you O
must O
, O
for O
example O
, O
do O
your O
shopping O
on O
the B-TIME
morning I-TIME
of O
She O
will O
, O
in O
fact O
, O
be O
surprised O
at O
what O
peace O
put O
all O
our O
energies O
into O
the O
particular O
matter O
on O
hand O

( O

that O

once O
again O
, O
we O
have O
a O

the O
saying O
of O
R. B-PER
Joshua I-PER

deals O
with O
a O

We O
know O
from O
the O

of O
Samuel B-PER
Pepys I-PER
that O
he O
was O
a O
great O

But O
this O
didn't O
mean O
he O
was O

as O
much O
for O
his O

the O
Victorian B-DATE

The O
simpler O

are O
extremely O
easy O
to O
work O

the O

being O
the O
more O
elaborate O
varieties O

however O
, O
a O
toe O
is O
worked O
in O
the O

this O
certainly O
complicates O
the O
operation O

For O
short O

is O
unnecessary O
to O

the O

Note O
that O
squared O

as O

as O

Although O
the O

, O
remember O
to O
go O
over O
each O
piece O
with O
a O

otherwise O
the O

All O
the O

are O
simple O

which O
should O
nevertheless O
be O
cut O
with O

to O
ensure O
a O

The O

is O
left O
to O
personal O
choice O
and O
the O
width O
is O
best O
taken O
directly O
from O
the O

to O
ensure O
a O
good O

Fix O

These O
can O
then O
be O

When O
determining O
To O
complete O
the O

, O
screw O
two B-CARDINAL

Make O
sure O
that O
these O
are O
well O
secured O
as O
they O
will O
have O
to O
withstand O
considerable O
pulling O
as O
the O

Here O
are O
the O
plans O
of O
a O
very O
seaworthy O
little O
rowing O
dinghy O
many O
of O
which O
I O
have O
built O
and O
sold O
. O

It O
is O
especially O
designed O
for O
simplicity O
in O
construction O
, O
cheapness O
and O
lightness O
of O
weight O
, O
and O
measures O
approximately B-QUANTITY

three B-CARDINAL

with O
a O

For O
instance O
, O
in O
Canada B-GPE
we O
use O
galvanised O
nails O
in O
place O
of O
screws O
. O

We O
just O
bend O
them O
over O
and O
clamp O
always O
used O
brass O
screws O
, O
which O
are O
more O
expensive O
. O

The O
first B-ORDINAL
is O
nailed O
and O
glued O
together O
strongly O
, O
it O
may O
be O
marked O
and O
cut O
to O
shape O
later O
. O

If O
you O
do O
not O
have O
a O
wooden O
floor O
on O
which O
to O
anchor O
the O
moulds O
, O
make O
a O
frame O
of O
rough O
lumber O
as O
shown O
in O
Fig. O
2 B-CARDINAL
. O

The O
main O
idea O
is O
to O
have O
the O
moulds O
standing O
as O
rigid O
as O
possible O
, O
for O
it O
is O
on O
these O
you O
will O
be O
building O
and O
shaping O
your O
little O
craft O
, O
upside-down O
. O

For O
cheapness O
I O
recommend O
using O
Douglas B-PRODUCT
Fir I-PRODUCT
Plywood I-PRODUCT
from O
British B-GPE
Columbia I-GPE
. O

The O
chine O
is O
the O
long O
stringer O
on O
each O
side O
which O
ash O
, O
spruce O
or O
any O
long O
grained O
flexible O
wood O
. O

I O
prefer O
spruce O
when O
available O
. O

As O
will O
be O
seen O
on O
each O
side O
. O

Having O
trimmed O
up O
the O
chines O
, O
we O
are O
now O
ready O
to O
plank O
the O
sides O
. O

Start O
again O
at O
the O
bows O
, O
round O
the O
frame O
to O
the O
stern O
and O
clamp O
there O
. O

If O
you O
have O
a O
third B-ORDINAL
clamp O
use O
it O
in O
the O
centre O
as O
well O
. O

After O
generously O
covering O
with O
glue O
, O
screw O
the O
sides O
to O
the O
transom O
framing O
and O
the O
chine O
. O

Use O
5/8 B-CARDINAL
by O
No. O
4 B-CARDINAL
gauge O
screws O
( O
brass O
) O
or O
nail O
with O
inch O
and O
a O
quarter O
galvanized O
nails O
, O
if O
you O
are O
doing O
it O
that O
way O
. O

Use O
flat O
head O
screws O
the O
1/4 B-QUANTITY
in. I-QUANTITY
ply O
. O

Make O
a O
very O
small O
hole O
for O
the O
screw O
to O
allow O
for O
a O
good O
grip O
. O

Remember O
to O
glue O
before O
screwing O
. O

Clean O
up O
with O
the O
plane O
ready O
for O
the O
bottom O
, O
trifle O
; O
this O
can O
be O
cleaned O
up O
later O
. O

As O
you O
are O
screwing O
and O
gluing O
this O
piece O
to O
the O
chines O
it O
is O
necessary O
to O
be O
careful O
not O
to O
miss O
the O
chine O
with O
the O
screws O
. O

I O
prefer O
spacing O
screws O
3 B-QUANTITY
in. I-QUANTITY
apart O
for O
the O
bottom O
, O
both O
for O
screwing O
to O
the O
chines O
and O
the O
bottom O
shaped O
transom O
facing O
. O

This O
could O
hardly O
happen O
without O
the O
herring O
having O
some O
orientation O
with O
the O
sea O
bottom O
. O

It O
means O
that O
the O
crowding O
is O
caused O
during O
the O
daytime O
, O
and O
that O
the O
herring O
must O
continue O
to O
migrate O
over O
the O
ground O
as O
well O
as O
in O
midwater O
and O
during O
the O
swim O
( O
the O
swim O
at O
East B-GPE
Anglia I-GPE
Thus O
we O
can O
see O
that O
herring O
movements O
, O
although O
primarily O
are O
also O
closely O
related O
to O
the O
sea-bed O
geography O
. O

Geography O
, O
too O
, O
names O
the O
great O
fisheries O
that O
depend O
on O
them O
: O
the O
herring O
spawn O
along O
the O
northern O
The O
effect O
of O
bottom O
congestion O
due O
to O
the O
light O
pressure O
is O
inevitably O
mixed O
with O
that O
of O
the O
suitability O
of O
ground O
for O
spawning O
. O

Both O
result O
in O
crowding O
, O
so O
there O
is O
no O
need O
to O
try O
to O
separate O
them O
- O
thank O
Heaven O
! O

A O
good O
picture O
of O
this O
is O
seen O
on O
the O
150 B-QUANTITY
miles I-QUANTITY
of O
spawning O
grounds O
from O
the O
Viking B-LOCATION
in O
the O
north O
down O
to O
the O
Klondykes B-LOCATION
and O
the O
Reef B-LOCATION
along O
the O
western O
edge O
of O
the O
Norwegian B-LOCATION
Deep I-LOCATION
. O

In O
this O
200-fathom B-QUANTITY
trench O
the O
herring O
do O
not O
touch O
the O
bottom O
. O

Their O
descent O
stops O
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
light O
pressure O
. O

But O
they O
migrate O
easterly O
to O
the O
Norwegian B-NORP
side O
, O
or O
westerly O
, O
until O
in O
the O
shallower O
water O
the O
mile O
wide O
layers O
disappear O
from O
the O
echo-sounders O
. O

Bottom O
crowding O
comes O
when O
they O
cannot O
reach O
their O
optimum O
depth O
; O
and O
this O
coincides O

the O

of O
any O

this O

A O

has O
been O
the O
biggest O
factor O
through O
the O

in O
the O

of O
this O
great O

fishery O
. O

The O
East B-NORP
Anglian I-NORP
behaviour O
( O
see O
p. O
82 B-CARDINAL
) O
has O
always O
differed O
from O
that O
of O
the B-DATE
summer I-DATE
fisheries O
. O

There O
is O
the O
" O
swim O
" O
at O
slack O
waters O
, O
even O
in O
daylight O
sometimes O
; O
and O
the O
high O
swimming O
, O
when O
fish O
are O
caught O
only O
in O
the O
top B-QUANTITY
few I-QUANTITY
yards I-QUANTITY
of O
netting O
. O

These O
and O
other O
fascinating O
behaviour O
mysteries O
are O
peculiar O
to O
this O
fishery O
, O
which O
unfortunately O
seems O
to O
be O
dying O
out O
; O
but O
a O
full O
discussion O
of O
them O
is O
beyond O
the O
present O
scope O
. O

The O
Bow-wave O
Theory O
. O

This O
assumes O
that O
all O
fishing O
gear O
, O
when O
moving O
, O
sends O
before O
it O
a O
kind O
of O
scaring O
effect O
, O
probably O
through O
waves O
or O
vibrations O
in O
the O
water O
or O
along O
the O
ground O
. O

Underwater O
films O
suggest O
that O
the O
footrope O
of O
a O
trawl O
does O
this O
. O

Films O
have O
also O
shown O
plaice O
moving O
before O
a O
seine O
net O
in O
just O
the O
same O
way O
after O
being O
gathered O
inwards O
by O
the O
ropes O
. O

sand O
; O
or O
even O
in O
the O
case O
of O
flat O
fish O
, O
by O
vibrations O
through O
or O
along O
the O
bottom O
. O

) O
But O
given O
such O
a O
bow O
wave O
of O
disturbance O
, O
it O
is O
obvious O
that O
without O
something O
Let O
us O
consider O
first B-ORDINAL
what O
would O
appear O
to O
be O
the O
simplest O
case O
- O
that O
of O
flat O
fish O
on O
the O
bottom O
. O

The O
evidence O
suggest O
that O
the O
fish O
are O
aware O
of O
the O
moving O
footrope O
before O
it O
, O
swimming O
at O
the O
same O
speed O
for O
an O
unknown O
period O
of O
time O
, O
until O
Then O
they O
stop O
swimming O
and O
are O
caught O
. O

In O
the O
seine-net O
film O
this O
usually O
seemed O
to O
happen O
just O
after O
the O
fish O
had O
risen O
above O
the O
footrope O
, O
and O
presumably O
out O
of O
its O
field O
of O
disturbance O
, O
or O
bow O
wave O
. O

This O
suggests O
that O
the O
wave O
might O
be O
transmitted O
by O
the O
sea-bed O
, O
though O
the O
footrope O
in O
this O
case O
was O
actually O
just O
off O
the O
bottom O
and O
was O
indeed O
passing O
over O
some O
fish O
. O

Actually O
the O
seine O
net O
has O
little O
or O
no O
cover O
. O

And O
in O
this O
film O
the O
rise O
of O
the O
fish O
was O
small O
, O
a O
matter O
of O
a B-QUANTITY
foot I-QUANTITY
or O
two B-CARDINAL
. O

With O
round O
fish O
like O
haddock O
, O
which O
would O
hardly O
would O
seem O
to O
be O
even O
more O
essential O
; O
but O
more O
films O
are O
needed O
to O
prove O
this O
. O

essential O
to O
catch O
round O
fish O
whose O
reaction O
to O
disturbance O
would O
be O
upwards O
The O
main O
disadvantage O
of O
the O
clay O
pot O
is O
its O
brittle O
nature O
; O
even O
with O
reasonably O
careful O
handling O
, O
the O
annual O
losses O
are O
often O
around B-PERCENT
10 I-PERCENT
per I-PERCENT
cent. I-PERCENT
, O
and O
where O
the O
handling O
and O
storage O
facilities O
are O
not O
too O
good O
, O
these O
losses O
will O
be O
even O
greater O
. O

This O
does O
not O
necessarily O
apply O
to O
the O
larger O
sizes O
, O
as O
they O
are O
not O
quite O
so O
fragile O
as O
the O
about O
in O
quite O
the O
same O
way O
. O

definite O
disadvantage O
. O

They O
are O
fairly O
heavy O
and O
difficult O
things O
to O
accommodate O
and O
they O
must O
have O
some O
protection O
from O
severe O
weather O
, O
which O
can O
be O
quite O
a O
headache O
in O
broken O
pots O
have O
on O
occasions O
provided O
artists O
with O
delightful O
studies O
, O
there O
is O
no O
doubt O
that O
a O
pile O
of O
badly O
stacked O
, O
half-broken B-CARDINAL
pots O
is O
an O
unlovely O
sight O
from O
any O
point O
of O
view O
. O

Every O
garden O
boy O
will O
agree O
that O
having O
to O
wash O
clay O
pots O
is O
a O
definite O
factor O
in O
favour O
of O
their O
abolition O
; O
in O
fact O
one B-CARDINAL
young O
man O
was O
so O
wholehearted O
about O
this O
a B-DATE
few I-DATE
years I-DATE
ago I-DATE
that O
he O
made O
the O
headlines O
for O
having O
smashed O
a O
large O
number O
 O
to O
relieve O
his O
feelings O
. O

On O
the O
small-to-medium O
establishment O
, O
it O
is O
a O
disagreeable O
chore O
which O
nobody O
tackles O
with O
any O
enthusiasm O
, O
whereas O
on O
larger O
establishments O
the O
pots O
can O
be O
sterilized O
or O
washed O
by O
machine O
. O

It O
is O
not O
easy O
to O
make O
an O
economic O
comparison O
between O
clay O
pots O
and O
the O
various O
substitutes O
; O
the O
former O
may O
last O
indefinitely O
with O
luck O
, O
while O
the O
latter O
are O
often O
expendable O
used O
only O
once O
. O

Clay O
pots O
are O
efficient O
and O
congenial O
containers O
in O
which O
to O
grow O
plants O
. O

In O
their O
proper O
setting O
they O
are O
not O
unattractive O
and O
, O
in O
spite O
of O
their O
shortcomings O
, O
most O
gardeners O
have O
a O
nostalgic O
affection O
for O
them O
. O

Present-day O
pots O
are O
better O
finished O
, O
do O
wash O
. O

The O
deep O
rims O
make O
for O
neater O
and O
safer O
stacking O
, O
though O
they O
are O
still O
expensive O
and O
still O
get O
broken O
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
there O
is O
really O
no O
replacement O
for O
the O
larger O
sizes O
, O
so O
they O
have O
the O
decided O
advantage O
of O
being O
the O
only O
suitable O
container O
available O
in O

for O
fairly O
large O

on O
the O

as O
to O

He O
does O
not O
The O
solitary O
learner O
has O
to O
find O
out O
how O
to O
do O
this O
for O
himself O
, O
with O
the O
help O
of O
books O
. O

He O
uses O
his O
vocabulary O
to O
ask O
questions O
and O
uses O
the O
books O
to O
Thus O
learning O
how O
to O
learn O
means O
becoming O
your O
own O
philosopher O
, O
your O
own O
psychologist O
and O
your O
own O
teacher O
. O

You O
will O
then O
be O
a O
well-established O
learner O
and O
the O

will O
be O
at O
your O
feet O

Although O
the O
word O
" O
mind O
" O
has O
given O
rise O
to O
endless O
controversy O
among O
philosophers O
and O
psycho- O
logists O
, O
many O
of O
whom O
would O
like O
to O
abolish O
it O
from O
the O
dictionary O
, O
most O
of O
us O
obstinately O
go O
on O
using O
it O
. O

to O
detach O
the O
mind O
from O
the O
brain O
, O
and O
all O
the O
biological O
, O
word O
" O
soul O
" O
to O
stand O
for O
what O
many O
believe O
to O
be O
the O
imperishable O
the O
body O
, O
and O
to O
reserve O
the O
more O
prosaic O
word O
" O
mind O
" O
for O
the O
basis O
of O
all O
those O
experiences O
and O
phenomena O
which O
are O
clearly O
associated O
with O
the O
brain O
. O

Can O
we O
now O
put O
forward O
any O
reasonably O
clear O
with O
the O
atomic O
theory O
, O
in O
giving O
a O
clear O
and O
detailed O
picture O
of O
the O
basis O
of O
such O
material O
phenomena O
as O
chemical O
action O
, O
magnetism O
, O
the O
behaviour O
of O
gases O
and O
so O
on O
. O

Where O
has O
psychology O
got O
to O
in O
its O
theories O
of O
" O
mind O
" O
? O

Are O
there O
any O
ultimate O
units O
of O
mind O
akin O
to O
the O
atoms O
of O
matter O
? O

At O
one O
time O
it O
was O
thought O
that O
mind O
could O
indeed O
be O
analysed O
into O
discrete O
bits O
. O

These O
bits O
were O
identified O
as O
elementary O
sensations O
. O

These O
were O
thought O
to O
combine O
together O
to O
form O
compound O
experiences O
by O
analogy O
with O
the O
way O
atoms O
of O
matter O
combine O
to O
form O
molecular O
compounds O
. O

But O
this O
view O
led O
to O
too O
many O
difficulties O
and O
was O
finally O
abandoned O
. O

Nevertheless O
the O
search O
for O
basic O
units O
of O
mind O
has O
gone O
on O
and O
will O
doubtless O
continue O
, O
for O
it O
is O
the O
aim O
of O
science O
to O
discover O
ultimate O
units O
. O

It O
is O
the O
tendency O
to O
get O
things O
the O
wrong O
way O
round O
. O

As O
a O
psychologist O
I O
am O
constantly O
encountering O
this O
tendency O
in O
friends O
and O
acquaintances O
. O

They O
think O
there O
is O
something O
inevitably O
" O
queer O
" O
about O
psychology O
and O
this O
feeling O
of O
queerness O
usually O
boils O
down O
to O
a O
quite O
mistaken O
belief O
that O
the O
psychologist O
first B-ORDINAL
looks O
into O
... O
directly O
look O
into O
the O
mental O
processes O
of O
another O
person O
they O
observe O
his O
visible O
behaviour O
and O
then O
try O
to O
give O
theoretical O
interpretations O
of O
what O
lies O
behind O
this O
behaviour O
. O

This O
is O
no O
more O
queer O
than O
the O
method O
of O
the O
doctor O
who O
observes O
signs O
, O
and O
records O
symptoms O
, O
and O
diagnoses O
the O
inner O
states O
responsible O
for O
them O
. O

He O
may O
never O
have O
had O
the O
disease O
himself O
but O
he O
can O
nevertheless O
identify O
it O
. O

Similarly O
the O
psychologist O
has O
to O
be O
prepared O
to O
observe O
and O
make O
inferences O
about O
all O
kinds O
of O
processes O
in O
other O
people O
, O
whether O
or O
not O
they O
correspond O
with O
anything O
in O
his O
own O
experience O
. O

We O
know O
very O
little O
about O
the O
patterns O
of O
brain-activity O
which O
provide O
our O
schemas O
, O
nor O
do O
we O
need O
to O
know O
as O
far O
as O

these O
patterns O
are O
the O
concern O
of O

was O
suggested O
by O
Mr. O

M. I-PER
Banks I-PER

Assistant O

that O

might O
be O
ready O
for O

, O
their O
wages O
paid O
for O
the O
time O
thus O
spent O

An O
approach O
was O
made O
to O
about O
twenty B-CARDINAL
large O
firms O
and O
in O

the O

ded O
a O
course O
on O

full I-DATE

and O
it O
was O
made O
clear O
both O
to O
the O
men O
and O
their O
employers O
that O
the O
venture O
was O
an O
experiment O
from O
which O
the O
organisers O
hoped O
to O
learn O
as O
much O
as O
the O
participants O

. O

Are O
there O
differences O
in O
adjustment O
to O
ageing O
and O
retirement O
according O
to O
the O
occupational O
level O
of O
employees O
? O

. O

If O
so O
, O
which O
occupational O
levels O
are O
the O
better O
or O
the O
poorer O
prepared O
for O
successful O
adjustment O
to O
retirement O
and O
in O
what O
aspects O
? O

3 B-CARDINAL
. O

Does O
the O
evidence O
obtained O
support O
a O
rationale O
for O
adapting O
a O
pre-retirement O
planning O
and O
preparation O
programme O
to O
the O
needs O
of O
older O
employees O
of O
different O
occupational O
levels O
? O

Each O
time O
you O
rehearse O
you O
will O
probably O
put O
things O
in O
a O
different O
way O
. O

All O
the O
better O
! O

- O
it O
will O
sound O
much O
more O
spontaneous O
on O
the O
occasion O
itself O
. O

Remember O
your O
four B-CARDINAL
names O
- O
have O
the O
list O
with O
you O
if O
you O
like O
- O
and O
you O
simply O
can't O
be O
flummoxed O
! O

Of O
course O
, O
in O
any O
speech O
a O
good O
start O
and O
a O
good O
finish O
are O
half B-CARDINAL
the O
battle O
. O

So O
- O
see O
the O
next O
page O
! O

Yes O
, O
they O
are O
waiting O
for O
you O
. O

But O
there O
is O
no O
need O
to O
be O
frightened O
. O

The O
audience O
will O
eat O
out O
of O
your O
hand O
- O
if O
they O
like O
what O
you O
offer O
them O
. O

A O
good O
start O
will O
put O
them O
in O
a O
good O
humour O
. O

Ladies O
and O
gentlemen O
! O

I O
'm O
afraid O
I O
have O
not O
had O
much O
experience O
of O
public O
speaking O
. O

But O
that O
's O
a O
terrible O
way O
to O
begin O
! O

Why O
tell O
them O
you O
are O
a O
novice O
? O

It O
's O
their O
interest O
you O
want O
- O
not O
their O
sympathy O
. O

And O
you O
want O
to O
get O
it O
from O
the O
word O
vision O
keeps O
people O
at O
home O
. O

But O
you O
, O
at O
any O
rate O
, O
have O
proved O
that O
wrong O
. O

And O
they O
say O
, O
too O
, O
that O
television O
makes O
its O
appeal O
to O
those O
of O
lesser O
May O
I O
suggest O
that O
you O
have O
proved O
that O
right O
! O

Congratulations O
! O

And O
away O
you O
go O
into O
your O
speech O
. O

Take O
some O
thought O
, O
too O
, O
for O
your O
ending O
. O

Thank O
you O
for O
listening O
to O
me O
so O
patiently O
. O

A O
political O
candidate O
often O
used O
that O
finish O
. O

No O
wonder O
he O
didn't O
get O
in O
! O

Instead O
he O
might O
have O
ended O
this O
way O
: O
Well O
, O
those O
are O
my O
views O
. O

When O
he O
learned O
what O
was O
causing O
the O
commotion O
he O
became O
greatly O
alarmed O
, O
and O
after O
the O
body O
had O
been O
taken O
to O
St B-FAC
Thomas's I-FAC
Hospital I-FAC
it O
was O
his O
grief-stricken O
duty O
formally O
to O
identify O
Elizabeth B-PER
Camp I-PER
, O
aged O
thirty-three B-DATE
, O
the O
girl O
who O
was O
to O
have O
been O
his O
bride O
. O

There O
was O
little O
doubt O
of O
how O
she O
had O
met O
her O
death O
, O
and O
even O
less O
that O
it O
had O
been O
murder O
. O

The O
body O
was O
examined O
, O
and O
it O
was O
definitely O
established O
that O
no O
sexual O
assault O
had O
taken O
place O
. O

It O
seemed O
probable O
that O
the O
motive O
had O
been O
robbery O
, O
and O
this O
was O
further O
confirmed O
when O
a O
check O
was O
made O
with O
the O
woman's O
relations O
in O
Hounslow B-GPE
. O

Miss O
Camp B-PER
had O
been O
the O
housekeeper O
at O

and O
before O
coming O
up O
to O
London B-GPE
in O
the O
evening B-TIME
she O
had O
called O
on O
her O
two B-CARDINAL
sisters O
, O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
whom O
lived O
at O
Hammersmith B-GPE
and O
the O
Elizabeth B-PER
had O
left O
Hammersmith B-GPE
in O
the O
late B-TIME
afternoon I-TIME
, O
she O
had O
tea O
with O
her O
other O
sister O
, O
and O
then O
went O
to O
catch O
the O
7.42 B-CARDINAL
. O

Her O
sister O
saw O
her O
to O
the O
station O
, O
helping O
her O
with O
some O
of O
her O
packages O
. O

This O
sister O
was O
able O
to O
establish O
that O
she O
had O
carried O
a O
green O
purse O
and O
had O
bought O
a O
railway O
ticket O
. O

The O
police O
began O
a O
systematic O
search O
of O
the O
line O

no O
easy O
task O
, O
but O
one O
in O
which O
patience O

method O
Putney B-GPE

accepting O
the O
likelihood O
that O
Miss O

for O
the O

they O
did O
not O

the O

a O

Day O
by O
day O
the O
police O
followed O
up O
likely O
and O
even O
unlikely O
trails O

It O
was O
learned O
that O
Elizabeth B-PER
Camp I-PER
had O
been O
lending O
money O
to O
her O
relatives O
, O
and O
her O
brother-in-law O
was O
asked O
for O
woman O
had O
been O
engaged O
once O
before O
- O
to O
a O
barman O
named O
Brown B-PER
. O

This O
man O
agreed O
that O
his O
engagement O
had O
tiff O
, O
but O
denied O
that O
he O
owed O
Miss O
Camp B-PER
any O
money O
. O

All O
the O
while O
the O
police O
were O
casting O
about O
for O
a O
man O
who O
had O
been O
seen O
leaving O
the O
train O
at O
Wandsworth B-GPE

A O
passenger O
described O
this O
individual O
a O
dark O
moustache O
, O
and O
wearing O
a O
frockcoat O
and O
a O
top-hat O

The O
porter O
at O
the O
station O
bore O
out O
this O
Perhaps O
the O
news O
of O
their O
search O
got O
around O
, O
for O
a O
man O
did O
obligingly O
present O
himself O
committed O
the O
murder O

but O
he O
was O
mentally O
had O
been O
nowhere O
near O
the O
7.42 B-CARDINAL
that B-DATE
evening I-DATE

Even O
the O
bone O
cuff-links O
found O
beside O
the O
body O
, O
which O
had O
at O
first B-ORDINAL
been O
considered O
as O
belonging O
to O
the O
killer O
, O
proved O
yet O
another O
red O
herring O
, O
for O
it O
was O
learned O
that O
they O
had O
been O
borrowed O
by O
Elizabeth B-PER
Camp I-PER
from O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
her O
sisters O

A O
young O

Not O
in O
itself O
a O

, O
added O
to O
the O
knowledge O
that O
he O
had O
gone O
shopping O
in O
the O
town O
of O
Guil- B-GPE

for O
a O
false O

left O
him O
with O

( O
presumably O
feeling O
that O
a O

might O
enhance O

this O
was O
accepted O

which O
had O
dragged O

has O
always O
been O
something O
sinister O
in O
the O
idea O
of O

The O
building O
of O
them O
was O
one O
of O
the O
most O
dangerous O

there O
were O
many O
people O
who O
believed O
that O
to O
travel O
through O
tunnels O
would O
be O
an O
equally O
hazardous O
business O

Some O
thought O
that O
the O
result O
would O
be O
all O

of O
horrible O
illnesses O
brought O
on O
by O
the O
confined O
atmosphere O

" O
The O

an O
anti-railway O
industrialist O
when O
it O
was O
proposed O
to O
build O
the O

The O
mere O
thought O
of O
subterranean O
travel O
gave O

a O
feeling O
of O
danger O

For O
all O

there O
have O
been O
only B-CARDINAL

and O
a O
Mr O
Robert O
Money O
came O
forward O
to O
identify O
her O
as O
his O
sister O
, O
Mary B-PER
Money I-PER
, O
aged O
twenty-two B-DATE
. O

On O
the O
Sunday B-DATE
, O
the O
day O
of O
her O
death O
, O
she O
had O
gone O
out O
in O
the O
evening B-TIME
at O
about B-TIME
seven I-TIME
o'clock I-TIME
, O
telling O
her O
room-mate O
, O
Emma B-PER
Hone I-PER
, O
that O
she O
was O
going O
for O
a O
walk O
, O
but O
would O
not O
be O
gone O
for O
long O
. O

According O
to O
Miss O
Hone B-PER
, O
she O
had O
not O
been O
carrying O
a O
handbag O
, O
but O
she O
believed O
she O
had O
had O
a O
small O
purse O
. O

At O
Clapham B-FAC
Junction I-FAC
a O
ticket-collector O
was O
able O
to O
identify O
a O
photograph O
of O
the O
girl O
, O
and O
he O
said O
he O
had O
last O
seen O
her O
a O
train O
for O
the O
short O
run O
to O
Victoria B-FAC
. O

A O
passenger O
at O
Victoria B-FAC
said O
he O
had O
seen O
a O
young O
lady O
" O
as O
near O
as O
possible O
" O
like O
the O
photograph O
shown O
him O
, O
with O
a O
man O
" O
very O
close O
in O
conversation O
and O
walking O
arm O
in O
arm O
. O

" O
A O
guard O
reported O
that O
at O
East B-FAC
Croydon I-FAC
he O
had O
seen O
what O
was O
accepted O
as O
the O
same O
couple O
sitting O
close O
together O
in O
a O
first-class B-ORDINAL
compartment O
of O
the O
train O
from O
London B-FAC
Bridge I-FAC
of O
which O
he O
was O
in O
charge O
. O

The O
two B-CARDINAL
could O
have O
joined O
this O
train O
by O
taking O
one O
from O
Victoria B-FAC
and O
changing O
at O
East B-FAC
Croydon I-FAC
. O

He O
also O
believed O
that O
they O
had O
still O
been O
together O
at O
South B-FAC
Croydon I-FAC
, O
and O
he O
remembered O
Medical O
evidence O
established O
that O
Mary B-PER
Money I-PER
had O
been O
dead O
for O
about B-TIME
an I-TIME
hour I-TIME
before O
her O
body O
was O
discovered O
, O
and O
this O
matched O
reasonably O
well O
with O
the O
timetable O
of O
the O
train O
in O
question O
. O

More O
important O
evidence O
came O
from O
a O
signalman O
at O
Purley B-FAC
Oaks I-FAC
, O
who O
had O
seen O
, O
as O
the O
train O
passed O
his O
box O
, O
a O
couple O
struggling O
in O
a O
first-class B-ORDINAL
compartment O
; O
but O
he O
seemed O
to O
have O
been O
used O
to O
seeing O
couples O
engaged O
in O
In O
those B-DATE
early I-DATE
years I-DATE
1914-18 I-DATE
, O
life O
was O
very O
full O
both O
in O
the O
parish O
and O
in O
the O
wider O
war O
activities O
. O

The O
Bishop O
, O
knowing O
that O
I O
spent O
my O
holidays O
in O
Bavaria B-GPE
, O
asked O
me O
if O
I O
would O
do O
something O
for O
two B-CARDINAL
wards O
at O
the O
Royal B-FAC
Herbert I-FAC
Hospital I-FAC
, O
full O
of O
war O
prisoners O
. O

I O
was O
very O
glad O
to O
help O
in O
this O
way O
, O
and O
visited O
them O
frequently O
, O
establishing O
at O
once O
a O
friendly O
contact O
with O
the O
Bavarian B-NORP
wounded O
who O
were O
delighted O
to O
find O
someone O
who O
knew O
their O
native O
villages O
. O

I O
could O
at O
once O
notice O
the O
great O
antagonism O
between O
the O
Bavarians B-NORP
and O
the O
Prussians B-NORP
who O
openly O
scorned O
these O
more O
simple O
country O
folk O
. O

So O
far O
had O
our O
thinking O
led O
us O
in O
this O
matter O
of O
the O
" O
Werewolves B-ORG
" O
that O
we O
had O
contemplated O
the O
necessity O
of O
very O
special O
precautions O
to O
guard O
the O
lives O
of O
our O
airmen O
. O

Particular O
hatred O
, O
we O
felt O
, O
was O
bound O
to O
be O
aimed O
at O
the O
representatives O
of O
those O
who O
had O
, O
over O
the B-DATE

spread O
such O
ghastly O
havoc O

destruction O

death O
over O

among O

head O
slowly O
from O
side O

side O

went O

got O
out O

traversed O
the O

streets O
as O
he O
had O
the O
night B-TIME
before O
, O
to O
keep O
an O
appointment O
with O
Heather B-PER
. O

" O
The O
Thetans B-NORP
, O
" O
he O
said O
, O
" O
are O
presumably O
here O
to O
take O
charge O
, O
as O
it O
were O
, O
of O
the O
minds O
of O
the O
people O
- O
who O
are O
probably O
falling O
all O
over O
them- O
selves O
in O
their O
zeal O
to O
get O
their O
orders O
and O
to O
carry O
them O
out O
. O

Just O
what O
these O
orders O
will O
be O
, O
we O
don't O
know O
. O

Now O
, O
because O
of O
prior O
hypnosis O
we O
have O
es- O
caped O
Thetan B-GPE
subjugation O
. O

This O
time O
. O

But O
we O
no O
longer O
have O
any O
immunity O
. O

There O
can O
be O
little O
doubt O
that O
if O
the O
Thetans B-NORP
discover O
our O
mental O
independence O
they O
will O
promptly O
give O
us O
their O
hypnotic O
treatment O
. O

If O
we O
can O
avoid O
undue O
prominence O
, O
it O
may O
be O
that O
we O
can O
move O
about O
pretty O
freely O
without O
detection O

If O
we O
can O
- O
well O
, O
then O
we O
interests O

What O
those O
interests O
are O
, O
beyond O
personal O
security O
, O
I O
haven't O
a O
clue O
; O
but O
, O
who O
knows O
, O
" O
Now O
, O
to O
summarize O
what O
I O
think O
our O
course O
of O
action O
should O
be O
. O

First B-ORDINAL
, O
to O
avoid O
the O
Thetans B-NORP
like O
the O
plague O
, O
for O
they O
must O
not O
find O
us O
out O
! O

Second B-ORDINAL
, O
to O
tread O
pretty O
warily O
among O
our O
own O
people O
, O
finding O
out O
just O
how O
much O
freedom O
we O
can O
take O
with O
safety O
. O

And O
third B-ORDINAL
, O
to O
study O
these O
damned O
Thetans B-NORP
. O

We O
must O
learn O
all O
we O
can O
about O
them O
. O

There O
is O
just O
a O
hope O
that O
we O
may O
uncover O
some O
weakness O
, O
and O
find O
a O
way O
of O
fighting O
back O
at O
them O
. O

" O
Heather B-PER
agreed O
, O
and O
suggested O
that O
they O
use O
Dan B-PER
as O
a O
specimen O
demonstra- O
ting O
how O
the O
Thetan B-GPE
machinations O
had O
been O
working O
out O
. O

It O
occurred O
to O
Steve B-PER
that O
this O
may O
not O
have O
been O
entirely O
an O
objective O
suggestion O
on O
her O
part O
; O
but O
he O
thought O
it O
a O
good O
idea O
So O
they O
proceeded O
to O
see O
if O
the O
coast O
was O
clear O
. O

The O
street O
was O
quiet O
and O
nor O
sound O
of O
flying O
saucers O
. O

So O
they O
ventured O
forth O
and O
made O
their O
way O
on O
foot O
to O
Dan's B-PER
house O
. O

Dan B-PER
came O
to O
the O
door O
at O
their O
ring O
but O
neglected O
to O
offer O
any O
greeting O
. O

He O
was O
deeply O
preoccupied O
, O
and O
it O
seemed O
that O
the O
ringing O
of O
a O
doorbell O
was O
to O
him O
a O
new O
and O
strange O
phenomenon O
. O

When O
he O
finally O
beckoned O
to O
them O
to O
enter O
, O
the O
action O
gave O
the O
impression O
of O
having O
been O
thought O
out O
and O
their O
heads O
like O
tennis O
spectators O
as O
he O
walked O
up O
and O
down O
, O
up O
and O
down O
. O

Then O
he O
would O
go O
back O
to O
Plato B-LOCATION
for O
a O
final O
spell O
of O
real O
days O
and O
would O
return O
to O
New B-GPE
York I-GPE
in O
late B-DATE
little O
sorry O
if O
we O
were O
not O
back O
for O
Christmas B-DATE
as O
arranged O
, O
but O
he O

Alastair B-PER
was O
a O
bachelor O
. O

All O
his O
life O
he O
had O
been O
inclined O
to O
regard O
women O
as O
something O
which O
must O
necessarily O
be O
subordinated O
to O
his O
career O
. O

Now O
he O
realised O
that O
he O
was O
entrusting O
not O
only O
his O
own O
life O
, O
but O
Geoffrey's B-PER
as O
well O
, O
to O
a O
strange O
girl O
whom O
he O
had O
never O
met O
and O
on O
whom O

no O

Alastair B-PER
was O
quite O
unable O

should O
feel O
so O
much O
confidence O
in O
her O
. O

Once O
again O
she O
checked O
back O
her O
instructions O
. O

It O
was O
obvious O
that O
she O
did O
not O
fail O
to O
appreciate O
the O
faith O
which O
he O
was O
placing O
in O
her O
and O
was O
prepared O

accept O

I O

They O
might O
have O
been O

Then O
she O
rang O
off O

Alastair B-PER
admitted O
that O
never O
in O
a O
not O
altogether O
uneventful O
life O
had O
he O
come O
across O
a O
girl O
who O
sounded O
so O
charming O
and O
appeared O
to O
be O
so O
efficient O
. O

For O
some O
reason O
the O
orderlies O
had O
forgotten O
to O
switch O
on O
the O
lights O
; O
there O
was O
no O
colour O
- O
physical O
features O
were O
distinguishable O
solely O
by O
gradations O
of O
silvery O
greyness O
. O

Even O
the O
snow- O
capped O
summit O
of O
Mont B-LOCATION
Blanc I-LOCATION
, O
seven B-QUANTITY

was O
not O

among O
the O
host O
of O

The O
screen O
of O
the O
air-to-air O

Occasionally O
minute O
spots O
flickered O
across O
its O
surface O
, O
but O
there O
was O
In O
the O
exceptional O
clarity O
he O
was O
even O
able O
to O
make O
a O
direct O
comparison O
between O
the O

and O
the O

itself O

any O

its O

Geoffrey B-PER
ground O
immediately O
ahead O
. O

He O
was O
able O
to O
pick O
out O
towns O
, O
unrecognisable O
to O
the O
naked O
eye O
, O
obscured O
by O
the O
ground O
haze O
which O
even O
on O
the O
clearest O
night B-TIME
limited O
angular O

. O

He O
glanced O
at O
the O

. O

It O
seemed O
almost O
incredible O
that O
the O
tiny O
white O
figure O
of O
8.5 B-CARDINAL
against O
which O
the O

was O
resting O
could O
really O
mean O

Now O
, O
as O
Alastair B-PER
reduced O

changed O

Alastair B-PER
talked O
of O

they O
were O
still O
more B-QUANTITY

They O
were O
nearing O

Geoffrey B-PER

Geoffrey B-PER
set O
himself O
to O
consider O
the O
movements O
of O

had O
passed O
him O
at O

a B-TIME
few I-TIME

past I-TIME
ten I-TIME
on O
the B-TIME

. O

He O
worked O
out O
the O
distance O
on O
the O
presumption O
that O
its O
route O
had O
been O
through O
Florence B-GPE
and O
Rome B-GPE
and O
then O
across O
Italy B-GPE
via O
Foggia B-GPE
to O
Barletta B-GPE

It O
came O
to O
just B-QUANTITY

DARKNESS O
had O
descended O
like O
a O

by O
the O
time O
they O
docked O
at O
Belleray B-GPE
. O

And O
though O
Guy B-PER
, O
made O
nervous O
by O
Beryl's B-PER
silence O
, O
drove O
at O
reckless O
speed O
to O
the O
Villa O
, O
it O
was O
quickly O
evident O
that O
the O
party O
was O
over O
. O

Piers B-PER
came O
strolling O
out O
to O
meet O
the O
Deanes B-PER
, O
and O
as O
soon O
as O
Guy B-PER
had O
driven O
away O
, O
invited O
them O
casually O
to O
come O
to O
his O
flat O
for O
a O
drink O
. O

To O
Beryl B-PER
, O
at O
least O
, O
this O
was O
anti-climax O
with O
a O
vengeance O
. O

She O
had O
expected O
to O
be O
met O
with O
violent O
reproaches O
- O
and O
here O
he O
was O
bland O
and O
smiling O
. O

But O
it O
did O
not O
take O
her O
long O
to O
realise O
that O
his O
mood O
was O
less O
pleasant O
than O
appeared O
on O
the O
surface O
. O

He O
told O
her O
nonchalantly O
, O
as O
he O
led O
the O
way O
to O
his O
own O
veranda O
, O
that O
he O
had O
taken O
the O
liberty O
of O
asking O
Jack B-PER
- O
as O
a O
representative O
of O
the O
Vallin B-PER
family O
- O
to O
come O
over O
and O
make O
the O
presentation O
in O
her O
stead O

" O
I O
caught O
him O
just O
as O

the O

'd O
asked O
him O
last B-TIME
night I-TIME

deputise O
for O
me O
and O
fetch O
her O
. O

He O
brought O
her O
to O
the O
party O
said O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
thing O
that O
came O
into O
her O
head O

casual O
tone O
, O
" O
She O
's O
not O
returning O
to O
her O

She O
's O
going O
to O
live O
with O

of O
the O

manager O
, O
just O
this O
side O
of O
Belleray B-GPE
. O

" O
Mrs. O
Deane B-PER
made O
a O
suitable O
comment O
, O
but O
Beryl B-PER
said O
nothing O
. O

She O
was O
trying O
to O
sort O
things O
out O
in O
her O
mind O
. O

That O
beneath O
his O
unnaturally O
smooth O
exterior O
Piers B-PER
was O
simmering O
with O
anger O
against O
her O
she O
had O
no O
doubt O
. O

had O
had O
a O
thoroughly O
good O
time O
, O
and O
it O
would O
take O
them O
nearly O
to O
next B-DATE
week I-DATE
to O
settle O
down O
again O
. O

Meanwhile O
Hubert B-PER
would O
have O
betaken O
himself O
and O
his O
well- O
With O
an O
air O
of O
resignation O
he O
sent O
Judy B-PER
, O
his O
Boxer O
, O
to O
the O
back O
, O
and O
made O
room O
for O
her O
beside O
him O
. O

" O
Is O
that O
all O
you O
want O
to O
do O
? O

" O
he O
asked O
, O
letting O
in O
the O
clutch O
. O

" O
No O
; O
I O
want O
to O
make O
you O
understand O
just O
what O
happened O
about O
this O
Balicou B-GPE

" O
she O
returned O
coldly O
. O

" O
I O
'm O
a O
little O
tired O
of O
being O
treated O
like O
an O
ineffective O
imbecile O

" O
" O
And O
I O
'm O
heartily O
sick O
of O
being O
constantly O
called O
to O
account O
for O
my O

" O
he O
retorted O
. O

" O
What O
have O
I O
done O
wrong O
now O
? O

I O
cover O
up O
for O
you O
the O
best O

it O
was O

down O

" O
to O
understand O
all O
the O
whys O
and O

of O
your O
actions O

" O
he O
said O
stiffly O

" O
Still O
less O
to O
criticise O
you O

" O
" O
Oh O

she O
exclaimed O
, O
with O
mounting O
exasperation O
. O

" O
Very O
well O

" O
He O
brought O
the O
jeep B-PRODUCT

a O

a O
rough O
path O
fringed O

shaded O
by O

some O

Graybury B-ORG

I O
'll O
give O
you O
credit O
for O
that O

But O
you O
didn't O
press O
the O

because O

very O
naturally O

you O
were O
thoroughly O
enjoying O
Forrest's B-PER

in O
idyllic O

" O
" O
How O

such O
a O

she O

" O

was O
his O
equally O
indignant O
rejoinder O

avoided O

tried O

that O

What O

" O
THERE O
were O
six B-CARDINAL

lying O
in O

alongside O
the O
jetty O
at O
Fort B-FAC
Blockhouse I-FAC
. O

Black O
and O
grimly O
businesslike O
they O
both O
looked O
and O
sounded O
, O
for O
all O
of O
them O
were O
rumbling O
as O
they O
charged O
their O
electric O
batteries O
. O

A O
light O
wind O
wafted O
the O
smoke O
of O
diesel O
exhaust O
in O
through O
the O
open O
windows O
of O
the O
Captain's O
house O
. O

It O
pervaded O
every O
room O
but O
neither O
Harry B-PER
nor O
Madeleine B-PER
Turton I-PER
noticed O
its O
existence O
as O
they O
sat O
in O
silence O
over O
a O
substantial O
breakfast O
. O

Although O
usually O
a O
very O
talkative O
lady O
Madeleine B-PER
respected O
her O
husband's O
silences O
, O
for O
she O
knew O
they O
betokened O
a O
worry O
of O
some O
sort O

There O
had O
been O
many O
such O
breakfasts O
lately O
since O
the O
affair O
of O
Parsifal B-PER

Harry B-PER
had O
lost O
a O
good O
deal O
of O
weight O
. O

His O
normal O
placid O
and O
steady-going O
manner O
remained O
, O
but O
she O
could O
see O
that O
it O
no O
longer O
came O
naturally O
. O

It O
is O
the O
common O
lot O
of O
all O
Squadron O
Senior O
Officers O
to O
experience O
such O
catastrophes O
as O
the O
loss O
of O
a O
submarine O
, O
though O
in O
peace O
time O
these O
happenings O
are O
few O
and O
far O
between O
. O

This O
is O
the O
testing O
time O
for O
all O
. O

The O
affair O
blows O
up O
into O
a O
national O
disaster O
and O
then O
when O
it O
is O
all O
over O
life O
must O
continue O
as O
before O
. O

During O
this O
period O
the O
Captain O
must O
present O
an O
unruffled O
appearance O
and O
carry O
on O
as O
if O
nothing O
unusual O
has O
happened O
. O

Harry B-PER
Turton I-PER
had O
written O
letters O
to O
the O
bereaved O
, O
had O
visited O
many O
in O
the O
locality O
, O
had O
been O
interviewed O
by O
the O

, O
had O
driven O
his O
surviving O
submarines O
a O
good O
deal O
harder O
than O
usual O
and O
in O
fact O
had O
applied O
all O
the O
usual O
specifics O
suitable O
for O
such O
occasions O

Mr. O
Copthorne B-PER
knew O
a O
way O
round O
by O
the O
side O
of O
the O
church O
where O
there O
was O
a O
small O
open O
outbuilding O
where O
the O
grave O
digger O
kept O
his O
spades O
and O
forks O
and O
tidying O
up O

. O

It O
might O
be O
open O

It O
was O

He O
entered O
, O
and O
seated O
himself O
in O
a O
huddle O
upon O
an O
upturned O
wheelbarrow O
. O

His O
curious O
headgear O
fell O
off O
. O

Strange O
things O
were O
going O
on O
in O
his O
bewildered O
brain O
. O

When O
a O
man O
was O
drowning O
and O
towards O
his O
last O
gasp O
it O
was O
scientifically O
supposed O
his O
whole O

travelled O
down O

" O
The O

were O

" O
The O
girl O

The O
porter O
brought O
Gavin's B-PER
bag O
out O
to O
the O
hand O
and O
smiled O

" O
I O
want O

up O

" O
Gay B-PER
went O
out O
to O

waiting O

then O
found O
that O
in O
the O
excitement O
of O
meeting O
Gavin B-PER
she O
had O
left O
her O
sun- O
glasses O
on O

She O
went O
quickly O
back O

fetch O
them O
. O

Gavin B-PER
and O
the O
girl O
who O
had O
got O
off O
the O
plane O
with O
him O
were O
talking O
. O

He O
was O
writing O
something O
in O
his O
pocket-book O
, O
with O
a O
sick O
feeling O
of O
despair O
Gay B-PER
knew O
that O
of O
course O
miserable O
, O
shy O
, O
who O
had O
sat O
at O
the O
little O
table O
for O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
time O
a B-DATE
few I-DATE

. O

Gavin B-PER
raised O
his O
glass O
to O
her O
and O
smiled O
and O
Gay's B-PER
heart O
turned O
over O
. O

" O
I O
'd O
like O
to O
do O
that O
. O

" O
Gavin B-PER
drained O
his O
glass O
and O
refilled O
it O
. O

" O
And O
then O
we O
'll O
go O
for O
a O
stroll O
along O
the O
beach O
. O

A O
moon B-LOCATION
like O
this O
mustn't O
be O
wasted O

" O
He O
gestured O
towards O
the O
bay O
where O
the O
full O
moon B-LOCATION
was O
just O
rising O
over O
the O
rocks O
, O
then O
laid O
his O
hand O
on O
hers O
. O

Gay B-PER
smiled O
at O
him O
only O
, O
yet O
remembering O
for O
a B-TIME
second I-TIME
the O
kisses O
she O
had O
seen O
him O
giving O
Elaine B-PER
. O

As O
he O
swung O
her O
on O
to O
the O
floor O
Gay B-PER
saw O
Gavin B-PER
and O
Simone B-PER
go O
through O
the O
doorway O
that O
led O
down O
to O
the O
beach O
. O

Gay B-PER
closed O
her O
eyes O
for O
a O
moment O
in O
disgust O
. O

She O
was O
fully O
aware O
that O
Gavin B-PER
would O
make O
love O
to O
the O
French B-NORP
girl O
on O
the O
sands O
, O
and O
no O

he O
would O
come O
back O
soon O

" O
Doc B-PER
nodded O
towards O
the O
door O
. O

" O
You O
may O
consider O
him O
a O
man O
, O
I O
would O
say O
he O
was O
a O
weakly O

" O
you O

" O
" O
I O

I O
think O
I O
can O
safely O
say O
that O
I O
know O
him O
a O
great O

better O
than O
you O

" O
Gay B-PER
nodded O
. O

" O
I O
know O
that O
you O
're O
right O

I O
think O

Doc B-PER
asked O
Lilyan B-PER
to O
dance O
and O
once O
again O
Gay B-PER
found O
herself O
alone O
at O
the O
table O
feeling O
self-conscious O
and O
awkward O
, O
sure O
that O
people O
were O
talking O
about O
the O
way O
Gavin B-PER
was O
behaving O
since O
they O
had O
seen O
them O
dining O
together O
. O

She O
opened O
her O
bag O
to O
get O
out O
her O
compact O
and O
saw O
Grace's B-PER
letter O
. O

She O
drew O
it O
out O
and O
opened O
it O
, O
glad O
to O
be O
able O
to O
occupy O
herself O

" O

it O
back O

Diana B-PER
Wills I-PER
often O
sat O
on O
the O
brand O
new O
seat O
outside O
the O
hospital O
gates O
and O
thought O
vagrant O
thoughts O
. O

At O
one B-CARDINAL
time O
she O
had O
watched O
the O
workmen O
constructing O
to O
put O
St. B-ORG
John's I-ORG
Casualty I-ORG
Department I-ORG
out O
of O
operation O
- O
in O
theory O
, O
at O

. O

She O
would O
think O
of O
her- O
self O
as O
a O
stranger O
in O
these O
parts O
" O
There O
are O
all O
sorts O
of O
wonder- O
ful O
jobs O
in O
London B-GPE
and O
I O
could O
one O
has O
to O
know O
something O
about O
fishing O
and O
in O
Liverpool B-GPE
they O
'd O
want O
sea-farers O
. O

I O
don't O
think O
I O
'd O
go O
to O
Edinburgh B-GPE
un- O
less O
I O
was O
a O
Scot B-NORP
and O
wanting O
to O
get O
home O
, O
or O
perhaps O
a O
student O
studying O
to O
be O
a O
doctor O
, O
and O
I O
already O
know O
all O
about O
that O
. O

" O
She O
was O
engaged O
to O
Nigel B-PER
, O
had O
been O
for O
two B-DATE
years I-DATE
. O

Sometimes O
they O
talked O
on O
the O
theme O
of O
" O
when O
we O
get O
married O
" O
, O
and O
then O
all O
was O
wonderful O
, O
and O
perhaps O
it O
had O
only O
been O
a O
slip O
of O
the O
tongue O
when O
Nigel B-PER
had O
said O
, O
only O
last B-TIME
that O
lark O
, O
I O
can O
tell O
you O
! O

" O
Now O
Nigel B-PER
had O
every O
right O
to O
go O
where O
he O
when O
she O
was O
not O
free O
; O
this O
much O
they O
had O
conceded O
one O
to O
the O
other O
. O

They O
rarely O
found O
they O
were O
off O
duty O
together O
, O
and O
the O
situation O
would O
have O
been O
intolerable O
about O
their O
relationship O
. O

So O
when O
Nigel B-PER
had O
told O
her O
about O
taking O
Luke's B-PER
evening B-TIME
surgery O
she O
had O
said O
, O
he O
shrugged O
diffidently O
, O
" O
I O
like O
the O
work O
. O

One O
gets O
plenty O
of O
variety O
and O
it O
's O
a O
change O
. O

" O
Nigel B-PER
was O
the O
hospital's O
Junior O
Medical O
Officer O
. O

" O
You O
won't O
be O
free O
about B-CARDINAL
nine I-CARDINAL
, O
I O
suppose O
, O
to O
meet O
me O
for O
supper O
somewhere O
? O

" O
she O
had O
asked O
hopefully O
. O

" O
Hardly O
likely O
, O
my O
sweet O
. O

Luke's B-PER
surgery O
goes O
on O
for O
hours B-TIME
. O

If O
they O
get O
in O
before O
eight-thirty B-CARDINAL
, O
even O
though O
they O
're O
standing O
on O
one O
another's O
toes O
, O
I O
'll O
give O
you O
a O
ring O
, O
O.K. O
? O

" O
O.K. O
, O
" O
she O
had O
replied O
readily O
. O

So O
how O
could O
Nigel B-PER
have O
been O
at O
the O
Load B-FAC
of I-FAC
Trouble I-FAC
roadhouse O
, O
very B-TIME
evening I-TIME
? O

" O
No O
, O
" O
she O
told O
Phil B-PER
Gubbins I-PER
, O
a O
junior O
my O
lad O
. O

" O
" O
It O
was O
Nigel's B-PER
car O
, O
anyway O
. O

NUF O
121 B-CARDINAL
. O

" O
" O
He O
probably O
loaned O
his O
car O
to O
somebody O
, O
Phil B-PER
. O

He O
's O
always O
doing O
that O
. O

" O
Young O
Gubbins B-PER
shrugged O
. O

" O
I O
didn't O
see O
his O
face O
, O
Di B-PER
, O
but O
it O
certainly O
looked O
like O
Nigel B-PER
from O
the O
back O
. O

D.j. O
and O
all O
. O

Of O
course O
such O
as O
I O
couldn't O
afford O
to O
go O
into O
the O
Load B-FAC
of I-FAC
Trouble I-FAC
. O

" O
But O
after O
that O
slight O
slip O
of O
the O
tongue O
on O
Nigel's B-PER
part O
she O
had O
realised O
it O
was O
important O
enough O
for O
her O
to O
have O
remembered O
, O
and O
it O
was O
as O
though O
a O
red O
mist O
veiled O
her O
usually O
clear O
sight O
and O
made O
her O
think O
there O
was O
an O
abyss O
immediately O
ahead O
. O

" O
Nigel B-PER
, O
" O
she O
had O
besought O
him O
, O
" O
you O
know O
that B-TIME
evening I-TIME
you O
took O
Luke B-PER
Parson's I-PER
surgery O
and O
there O
was O
a O
woman O
with O
a O
cyst O
on O
her O
ear O
... O
? O

" O
" O
5Ye-es O
? O

" O
he O
lowered O
his O
eyes O
and O
kissed O
her O
on O
the O
mouth O
, O
an O
act O
of O
devotion O
he O
didn't O
over-indulge O
. O

" O
What O
about O
it O
, O
my O
sweet O
? O

" O
" O
Well O
, O
" O
she O
laughed O
suddenly O
in O
an O
upsurging O
of O
relief O
, O
" O
that O
stupid O
Gubbins B-PER
boy O
thought O
he O
saw O
you O
at O
the O
Load B-FAC
of I-FAC
Trouble I-FAC
. O

With O
a O
blonde O
, O
too O

" O
Nigel B-PER
was O
frowning O
. O

He O
looked O
distinguished O
when O
he O
frowned O
; O
boyishly O
Though O
Diana B-PER
knew O
the O
name O
of O
every O
member O
of O
the O

, O
distinguished O
or O
not O

Nigel B-PER
often O
had O
to O

" O

I O

you O

for O
Her O
figure O
was O
small O

exquisite O
, O
like O
a O

, O
and O
he O
admired O
her O

which O
the O

" O
I O

" O
he O
told O
her O
grimly O
, O
and O
tugged O
her O
fiercely O
into O
his O
arms O
. O

" O
You O
're O

" O
" O
No O

he O

strangely O

" O

Di B-PER

Like O
a O

her O

She O
loosened O
the O
half-hoop B-CARDINAL
of O
diamonds O
on O
her O
left O
hand O
third B-ORDINAL
finger O
and O
held O
it O
out O

Without O

he O

" O
" O

" O
They O
were O

Almost O
in O

he O
he O
told O
her O

suddenly O
seized O
her O
in O
an O
embrace O
which O
really O
hurt O

" O
Without O

it O
's O
just O

kissed O
her O
again O
, O
somewhat O
startled O
to O
what O
you O

" O
she O
flashed O
at O
him O

and O
so O
had O
left O
him O

on O

not O

tidied O

Cecil B-PER
gritted O
his O
teeth O
and O
glowered O
at O
the O
in O
tax-free O
champagne O
whilst O
he O
had O
to O
go O
easy O
on O
the O
immersion O
heater O

' O
What O
is O
it O
, O
Cecil B-PER
? O

Don't O
you O
feel O
well O
? O

' O
his O
mother O
asked O
solicitously O
. O

' O
You O
do O
look O
tired O
. O

Go O
and O
get O
yourself O
a O
drink O
. O

' O
' O
Don't O
fuss O
, O
mother O
! O

I O
'm O
quite O
well O
and O
no O
more O
tired O
than O
usual O
, O
and O
we O
finished O
the O
gin O
last B-DATE
week I-DATE
, O
you O
know O
that O
. O

' O
Cecil B-PER
stepped O
towards O
the O
dining O
room O
. O

' O
I O
'm O
sure O
you O
must O
be O
tired O
, O
' O
his O
mother O
insisted O
. O

and O
I O
'm O
NOT O
irritable O
. O

' O
' O
Very O
well O
then O
. O

' O
His O
mother O
nodded O
with O
understanding O
. O

' O
You O
're O
not O
tired O
. O

Nobody O
's O
tired O
. O

Now O
just O
you O
run O
along O
upstairs O
and O
wash O
your O
hands O
whilst O
I O
get O
dinner O
ready O
. O

' O
Cecil B-PER
wriggled O
irritably O
under O
the O
misplaced O
management O
of O
a O
mother O
who O
had O
failed O
to O
realise O
that O
a O
son O
who O
is O
nearly O
bald O
is O
no O
longer O
a O
baby O
. O

He O
started O
to O
climb O
the O
stairs O
, O
stamping O
with O
unnecessary O
vigour O
upon O
the O
treads O
. O

' O
And O
don't O
wipe O
the O
dirt O
off O
on O
the O
towel O
like O
you O
did O
yesterday B-DATE
. O

Your O
Auntie O
Edie B-PER
's O
coming O
in O
for O
a O
cup O
of O
tea O
later O
and O
mother O
turned O
around O
in O
time O
to O
see O
the O
briefcase O
collapse O
against O
the O
brass O
umbrella O
stand O
. O

' O
Well O
now O
! O

' O
She O
hurried O
towards O
it O
and O
picked O
it O
up O
. O

what O
it O
's O
all O
about O
. O

' O
Cecil B-PER
halted O
in O
mid-step O
near O
the O
top O
of O
the O
stairs O
and O
turning O
round O
. O

She O
pointed O
to O
the O
irritable O
. O

You O
thought O
that O
I O
'd O
think O
upstairs O
with O
it O
. O

' O
And O
I O
've O
NOT O
been O
extravagant O
. O

' O
" O
Naughty O
! O

' O
she O
called O
In O
spite O
of O
all O
the O
transferred O
maternity O
she O
was O
endowed O
with O
by O
her O
patients O
, O
infant-in-arms O
but O
a O
new-born O
babe O
, O
a O
premature O
piece O
of O
frailty O
in O
an O
oxygen- O
tent O
of O
utter O
innocence O
. O

The O
complexity O
of O
that O
innocence O
was O
colossal O
. O

It O
had O
layer O
after O
layer O
of O
illusion O
to O
be O
peeled O
off O
and O
replaced O
with O
sad O
knowledgeability O
. O

It O
was O
a O
nakedness O
of O
nai"vety O
to O
be O
clothed O
leaf O
by O
leaf O
with O
the O
disappointment O
of O
experience O
. O

Her O
first B-ORDINAL
illusion O
consisted O
in O
the O
belief O
that O
all O
she O
need O
do O
was O
to O
go O
to O
an O
agent O
, O
visit O
half B-CARDINAL
a I-CARDINAL
dozen I-CARDINAL
houses O
in O
one B-DATE
day I-DATE
, O
choose O
one B-CARDINAL
, O
make O
an O
offer O
, O
put O
it O
in O
the O
hands O
of O
a O
lawyer O
and O
go O
away O
on O
her O
holiday O
while O
the O
whole O
transaction O
was O
put O
through O
. O

Fortunately O
, O
however O
, O
the O
fashion O
for O
Victorian B-NORP
architecture O
which O
Mr. O
John B-PER
Betjeman I-PER
had O
started O
several B-DATE
decades I-DATE
before O
had O
caught O
on O
at O
last O
and O
therefore O
saved O
the O
situation O
for O
the O
affluent O
middle-class O
, O
who O
now O
had O
plenty O
Serena B-PER
discovered O
, O
and O
more O
, O
but O
in O
stages O
. O

For O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
thing O
she O
did O
was O
to O
make O
an O
offer O
small O
back O
yard O
, O
newly O
dec. O
, O
near O
shops O
and O
tube O
The O
next O
thing O
that O
Serena B-PER
discovered O
was O
that O
And O
this O
in O
spite O
of O
having O
at O
last O
managed O
to O
save O
the O
ten B-PERCENT
percent I-PERCENT
needed O
. O

Or O
so O
she O
thought O
, O
being O
then O
in O
possession O
of O
what O
seemed O
to O
her O
the O
princely O
sum O
of O
six B-MONEY
hund- I-MONEY
red I-MONEY
pounds I-MONEY
. O

The O
lawyer O
said O
: O
" O
Of O
course O
you O
must O
count O
about B-CARDINAL
two I-CARDINAL
hundred I-CARDINAL
for O
legal O
charges O
and O
stamp O
duties O
, O
maybe O
less O
, O
depending O
on O
the O
price O
of O
the O
house O
, O
and O
whether O
it O
has O
been O
regis- O
tered O

I O
take O
it O
you O

a O
mortgage O
lined O
up O

then O

Mrs. O

Buttery B-PER

" O
" O
Not O
yet O
, O
but O
the O
bank O
would O
give O
me O
a O
loan O
, O
I O
'm O
sure O

" O
" O
Er O
, O
yes O

You O

some O

His O
aspect O
was O
as O
dusty O
as O
his O
office O
, O
with O
scurf O
from O
dusty O
hair O
on O
the O
dusty O
shoulders O
of O
his O
black O
suit O

cigarette O

down O
the O
front O

an O
ashen O
face O
and O
yellow O
sleepy O
dust O
in O
the O
corners O
of O
his O
pale O
grey O
eyes O
. O

His O
finger-nails O
were O
dirty O
, O
though O
he O
tried O
to O
make O
up O
for O
it O
by O
constantly O
paring O
them O
with O
the O
finger-nail O
of O
the O
opposite O
hand O
. O

" O
Yes O
, O
well O
... O
. O

" O
He O
judged O
that O
she O
had O
been O
sufficiently O
dazzled O

gave O
a O
long O
raucous O
cough O

let O
me O

I O

" O
" O
But O
, O
they O
're O
safe O
, O
are O
they O
? O

I O
mean O
, O
all O
mortgage O
companies O
are O
money-lenders O

That O
's O
rather O
the O
point O
, O
isn't O
it O
? O

" O
" O
No O
, O
but O
I O
mean O
- O
" O
to O
revise O
your O
ideas O
about O

the O
type O

I O
'm O
afraid O
we O
can't O
take O
yours O
into O

you O
'll O
find O
that O
no O

the O

Now O
you O
could O
get O
quite O
a O
nice O
little O
semi-detached O
house O
in O
Grimstead B-GPE
for O
three B-CARDINAL
thousand I-CARDINAL

that O

I O
forgot O
to O
tell O
you O
, O
we O
don't O
usually O

" O
we O
can O
get O
three B-CARDINAL
thousand I-CARDINAL
three I-CARDINAL
fifty I-CARDINAL
, O
perhaps O
a O
little O
more O
if O
we O
can O
cheat O
your O

a O

I O
'm O
sure O
you O
could O
raise O
the O

one B-CARDINAL

get O
two B-CARDINAL

a O

more O

wasn't O
