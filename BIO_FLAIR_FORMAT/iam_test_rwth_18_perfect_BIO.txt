There O
is O
a O

which O
attempt O
to O

the O
problems O
of O
the O
Fourth B-WORK_OF_ART
Gospel I-WORK_OF_ART
by O
explanations O
based O
on O
assumed O
textual O

. O

The O
present O
state O
of O
the O
Gospel B-WORK_OF_ART
is O
the O
result O
of O
an O
accident-prone O
history O
. O

The O
original O
was O
written O
on O
a O
roll O
, O
or O
codex O
, O
which O
fell O
into O
disorder O
or O
was O
accidentally O
damaged O
. O

editor O
, O
who O
was O

made O

he O
could O

the O
chaos O
by O
placing O
the O
fragments O
, O
or O
sheets O
, O
or O
pages O
, O
in O
order O
. O

case O
is O
that O
, O
in O
common O
with O
all O
his O
colleagues O
, O
he O
has O
not O
, O
until O
now O
, O
been O
able O
to O
exhibit O
exactly O
how O
this O
enlargement O
was O
effected O
nor O
has O
he O
been O
able O
to O
explain O
the O
textual O
movements O
by O
showing O
that O
such O
changes O
are O
part O
of O
a O
simple O
and O
coherent O
plan O
. O

To O
understand O
how O
this O
is O
possible O
it O
is O
necessary O
to O
examine O
the O
text O
of O
the O
Gospel B-WORK_OF_ART
. O

THE O
Fourth B-WORK_OF_ART
Gospel I-WORK_OF_ART
was O
almost O
certainly O
written O
in O
Greek B-LANGUAGE
. O

A O
modern O
text O
of O
the O
Gospel B-WORK_OF_ART
represents O
the O
work O
of O
generations O
of O
scholars O
who O
have O
compared O
the O
many O
manu- O
scripts O
of O
John B-PER
and O
worked O
out O
the O
version O
which O
is O
most O
likely O
to O
have O
been O
the O
original O
wording O
. O

It O
is O
not O
possible O
to O
establish O
any O
one O
text O
with O
absolute O
precision O
. O

The O
bar O
was O
the O
commonest O
marking O
, O
but O
others O
were O
also O
used O
. O

Dots O
sometimes O
served O
in O
place O
of O
the O
bar O
, O
and O
there O
are O
cases O
where O
spacing O
is O
used O
as O
it O
is O
now O
used O
to O
mark O
a O
paragraph O
ending O
. O

Frequently O
paragraphos O
markings O
were O
omitted O
. O

C. B-PER
H. I-PER
Roberts I-PER
is O
of O
the O
opinion O
that O
in O
the O
original O
of O
the O
Fourth B-WORK_OF_ART
Gospel I-WORK_OF_ART
some O
markings O
would O
be O
used O
, O
although O
which O
, O
it O
is O
impossible O
to O
say O
. O

the O
original O
of O
the O
Gospel B-WORK_OF_ART
would O
be O
unmarked O
. O

The O
original O
of O
the O
Gospel B-WORK_OF_ART
, O
whether O
written O
on O
a O
roll O
or O
codex O
, O
whether O
paragraphed O
or O
not O
, O
would O
be O
laid O
out O
in O
columns O
. O

This O
is O
the O
invariable O
practice O
of O
ancient O
manuscripts O
. O

A O
common O
size O
of O
column O
would O
hold O
The O
edge O
of O
this O
sheet O
was O
attached O
to O
a O
wooden O
dowel O
a O
simple O
and O
serviceable O
book O
. O

It O
was O
robust O
- O
the O
number O
which O
have O
survived O
the B-DATE
centuries I-DATE
is O
ample O
evidence O
of O
this O
- O
and O
it O
was O
easily O
stored O
. O

It O
had O
two B-CARDINAL
disadvantages O
. O

It O
was O
generally O
a O
single-sided O
form O
of O
book O
, O
and O
it O
was O
not O
This O
last O
objection O
might O
have O
had O
some O
weight O
in O
ecclesiastical O
circles O
. O

In O
his O
Natural O
History O
, O
13 B-CARDINAL
. O

11-12 B-CARDINAL
, O
the O
elder O
Pliny B-PER
tells O
of O
the O
use O
of O
papyrus O
in O
roll-making O
. O

As O
Pliny B-PER
was O
killed O
in O
the O
eruption O
of O
Vesuvius B-LOCATION
which O
overwhelmed O
Herculaneum B-GPE
and O
Pompeii B-GPE
in O
A.D. B-DATE
79 I-DATE
, O
his O
information O
is O
contemporaneous O
with O
the O
New B-WORK_OF_ART
Testament I-WORK_OF_ART
. O

The O
other O
form O
of O
book O
was O
the O
codex O
. O

In O
this O
the O
sheets O
were O
bound O
together O
down O
one B-CARDINAL
edge O
much O
as O
Against O
these O
advantages O
the O
codex O
was O
fragile O
and O
might O
be O
bulky O
. O

It O
is O
sometimes O
possible O
to O
tell O
whether O
or O
not O
a O
particular O
text O
was O
written O
on O
a O
roll O
or O
a O
codex O
. O

Rolls O
were O
prepared O
for O
writing O
, O
but O
any O
papyrus O
left O
unused O
at O
the O
end O
could O
be O
cut O
off O
. O

If O
the O
text O
was O
longer O
than O
the O
roll O
, O
a O
sheet O
could O
easily O
be O
glued O
on O
. O

The O
verso O
of O
the O
roll O
was O
blank O
, O
and O
one O
cannot O
think O
of O
an O
author O
, O
Mark B-PER
for O
example O
, O
sending O
out O
his O
Gospel B-WORK_OF_ART
lacking O
the O
ending O
, O
while O
one O
whole O
side O
of O
his O
roll O
was O
unused O
. O

The O
codex O
form O
was O
not O
so O
accommodating O
. O

Even O
in O
the O
case O
of O
the O
single-sheet O
quire O
, O
an O
extra O
sheet O
glued O
on O
might O
have O
to O
be O
gummed O
on O
over O
the O
binding O
, O
or O
the O

rebound O
. O

A O

and O
orchards O

The O
word O

was O
used O
as O
a O
personal O
name O
( O
Git. B-WORK_OF_ART

) O
. O

The O
Hebrew B-LANGUAGE
word O
" O
SHAMIR O
" O
means O
guarded O
or O
preser- O

Therefore O
, O
the O
real O
man O
, O
who O
regards O
himself O
as O
insignificant O
, O
as O
the O
prayer O
says O
: O
" O

And O

was O
it O
that O

Because O

The B-DATE

He O

quite O

though O
the O

The O

had O
high O

for O
James B-PER
had O
grown O
up O
in O
Presbyterian B-NORP
Scotland B-GPE
, O
but O
those O
hopes O
were O
dashed O
. O

True O
, O
a O
new O
Prayer B-WORK_OF_ART
Book I-WORK_OF_ART
was O
issued O
in O
1604 B-DATE
but O
the O
Puritans B-NORP
derived O
little O
comfort O
from O
it O

They O
objected O

So O
the O

the O
laying O

added O
to O
the O

This O
indicated O
how O
ephemeral O
in O
the O
Church B-ORG
had O
been O
the O
mood O
which O

It O
was O
at O
this O
time O
, O
too O
, O
that O
King O
James B-PER
made O
a O

translation O

the O

In O
that O

Bacon B-PER

James B-PER

Significantly O
this O
made O
a O
deliberate O
return O
to O
the O

Forever O
associated O
with O
Charles B-PER
is O
Archbishop O
Laud B-PER
, O
now O
so O
much O
nobler O
a O
figure O
than O
former O
historians O
led O
us O
to O
believe O
. O

Laud B-PER
was O
enthusiastically O
hated O
by O
Calvinists B-NORP
and O
Puritans B-NORP
, O
and O
the O
sentiment O
was O
mutual O
. O

But O
Laud B-PER
was O
no O
Romanizer O
. O

One B-CARDINAL
of O
his O
first B-ORDINAL
public O
acts O
was O
a O
hard-hitting O
battle O
with O
the O
Jesuit B-NORP
, O
Fisher B-PER
. O

But O
anyone O
who O
was O
friendly O
with O
James B-PER
and O
Charles B-PER
, O
the O
Puritans B-NORP
argued O
, O
was O
necessarily O
a O
menace O
. O

Laud B-PER
made O
a O
positive O
approach O
. O

He O
set O
out O
to O
increase O
a O
sense O
of O
reverence O
. O

The O
Prayer B-WORK_OF_ART
Book I-WORK_OF_ART
was O
to O
be O
respected O
and O
so O
was O
the O
office O
of O
a O
bishop O
. O

Altars O
should O
be O
altars O
and O
not O
any O
broken O
down O
, O
transportable O
table O
which O
was O
handy O
for O
the O
most O
improbable O
uses O
. O

Even O
worse O
is O
to O
laugh O
. O

Tremendous O
damage O
may O
be O
done O
to O
a O
child O
by O
laughing O
at O
what O
are O
very O
real O
fears O
. O

As O
adults O
, O
we O
know O
that O
their O
fears O
are O
groundless O
, O
indeed O
to O
us O
they O
appear O
laughable O
, O
but O
to O
a O
child O
they O
are O
very O
real O
. O

Not O
that O
I O
am O
suggesting O
that O
children O
should O
be O
molly-coddled O
- O
they O
must O
be O
made O
to O
face O
their O
fears O
, O
to O
see O
through O
them O
and O
come O
out O
on O
the O
other O
side O
as O
victors O
. O

To O
ridicule O
them O
only O
pushes O
them O
farther O
into O
themselves O
, O
so O
that O
they O
become O
unable O
to O
speak O
about O
it O
to O
anybody O
and O
the O
seeds O
of O
any O
amount O
of O
trouble O
are O
sown O
, O
the O
harvest O
of O
which O
may O
still O
be O
being O
reaped O
at O
forty B-CARDINAL
or O
fifty B-CARDINAL
. O

Far O
better O
to O
agree O
with O
a O
child O
that O
a O
particular O
situation O
is O
frightening O
, O
and O
then O
to O
face O
it O
together O
until O
the O
child O
can O
see O
how O
unnecessary O
its O
fears O
were O
. O

Because O
situations O
which O
may O
contain O
all O
the O
elements O
of O
fear O
can O
arise O
suddenly O
, O
it O
is O
a O
good O
idea O
to O
condition O
a O
child O
to O
some O
extent O
against O
it O
. O

To O
keep O
a O
child O
of O
twelve B-CARDINAL
or O
thirteen B-CARDINAL
under O
the O
impression O
that O
nothing O
nasty O
ever O
happens O
is O
not O
merely O
dishonest O
, O
it O
is O
unwise O
. O

As O
I O
shall O
suggest O
in O
a O
later O
chapter O
there O
are O
some O
situations O
which O
occur O
less O
frequently O
than O
In O
Gethsemane B-FAC
He O
prayed O
that O
the O
cup O
should O
pass O
from O
Him O
. O

Jesus B-PER
shows O
us O
the O
way O
to O
face O
life O
. O

To O
see O
all O
the O
latent O
frightening O
possibilities O
and O
yet O
by O
facing O
them O
and O
knowing O
God O
is O
with O
us O
and O
that O
, O
with O
Him O
, O
there O
is O
nothing O
that O
can O
finally O
defeat O
us O
. O

More O
than O
that O
, O
that O
God O
has O
something O
important O
to O
do O
with O
our O
lives O
and O
that O
the O
nearer O
we O
get O
to O
Him O
, O
the O
stronger O
we O
become O
. O

Was O
this O
: O
That O
a O
secret O
plan O
Is O
hid O
in O

of O
the O
plan O
That O
God O

Who O
dwells O

what O
it O

to O

really O

help O
us O

when O

what O

we O

when O
we O

To O
others O
, O
the O
long O
hours O
of O
the O
night B-TIME
bring O
only O
a O
disturbed O
tossing O
and O
turning O
which O
causes O
them O
to O
wake O
feeling O
worse O
than O
when O
they O
went O
to O
bed O
. O

We O
may O
begin O
to O
understand O
this O
a O
little O
better O
when O
we O
realize O
that O
tiredness O
itself O
is O
largely O
in O
the O
mind O
. O

Very O
few O
people O
, O
under O
normal O
conditions O
, O
work O
themselves O
to O
a O
standstill O
. O

The O
mind O
tires O
first B-ORDINAL
and O
conveys O
the O
impression O
of O
tiredness O
to O
the O
body O
. O

This O
can O
be O
proved O
by O
noting O
the O
effect O
of O
a O
new O
stimulus O
on O
some- O
body O
who O
feels O
thoroughly O
tired O
. O

Suppose O
a O
mother O
has O
news O
late B-TIME
at I-TIME
night I-TIME
that O
her O
child O
is O
in O
danger O
. O

She O
will O
undertake O
a O
journey O
which O
, O
an B-TIME
hour I-TIME
before O
, O
she O
would O
have O
declared O
impossible O
. O

Even O
more O
simply O
, O
test O
your O
own O
reactions O
to O
different O
situations O
. O

There O
are O
some O
which O
bring O
on O
an O
almost O
immediate O
feeling O
of O
tiredness O
- O
such O
as O
when O
your O
wife O
mentions O
refer O
to O
something O
you O
like O
doing O
, O
bring O
a O
veritable O
surge O
of O
energy O
. O

Many O
a O
girl O
who O
up O
with O
no O
apparent O
tiredness O
at O
all O
when O
her O
boy O
friend O
calls O
and O
go O
for O
a O
long O
walk O
. O

a O
burden O
to O
their O
families O
and O
their O
friends O
. O

Any O
mental O
confusion O
can O
cause O
this O
and O
the O
best O
way O
is O
probably O
to O
seek O
advice O
. O

As O
we O
are O
unable O
to O
cure O
our O
own O
bodies O
if O
the O
cause O
of O
our O
pain O
is O
too O
deep O
seated O
, O
so O
we O
are O
unable O
to O
cure O
our O
own O
minds O
, O
involving O
careful O
and O
patient O
treatment O
. O

One B-CARDINAL
of O
the O
greatest O
steps O
forward O
that O
has O
been O
made O
this B-DATE
century I-DATE
is O
the O
way O
in O
which O
illness O
of O
the O

is O
no O
longer O
feared O
or O
shunned O
, O
and O
is O
in O
fact O
no O
differently O
regarded O

physical O
illness O

There O
is O
, O
nevertheless O
, O
a O
great O
deal O
of O
tiredness O
which O
comes O
from O
no O
major O
complication O
but O
results O
from O
an O
inability O
to O
deal O

Even O

It O
is O
easy O

to O
lead O
a O

double O

life O
without O
ever O
deliberately O
planning O

so O
or O
in O

It O
is O
easier O
to O
live O
life O
in O
compartments O
but O
over O
the O
years O
it O
builds O
up O
, O
and O
to O
do O

inevitably O
builds O
up O

which O

we O

frame O
some O

Time O

time O
we O
forget O
something O
and O
have O
to O
go O
back O
upstairs O
or O
down O

The O

would O
find O
life O
far O
less O

if O
she O
made O
a O

followed O
a O

rather O
than O
getting O
from O
one O

The O

if O

To O

is O
more O

any- O

If O
we O
would O
only O
sit O
down O

write O

all O
the O
necessary O
jobs O
waiting O
to O
be O
done O
and O
then O
work O
quietly O

them O

we O
would O
find O
life O
considerably O
less O
exhausting O
I O
am O
more O
than O
conscious O
of O
this O

How O
anybody O
can O
go O
through O
the O

routine O
day O

out O
for O
forty B-DATE

find O
difficult O

may O

of O

I O
was O

some O
little O
while O

to O
hear O
of O
a O
school O
who O
tried O
a O
six- B-DATE

They O
only O
worked O
, O
of O
course O
, O
a B-DATE
five- I-DATE
day I-DATE
week I-DATE
so O
that O
in O
the B-DATE
first I-DATE
week I-DATE
Monday I-DATE
to I-DATE
Friday I-DATE
were O
days O
one B-CARDINAL
to O
five B-CARDINAL
of O
the O

the B-DATE
following I-DATE
Monday I-DATE
was O
day B-DATE

and O
Tuesday B-DATE
started O

one I-DATE
again O
and O
so O
on O

By O
this O
means O
they O
avoided O

the O

in O
the O

which O
day O
of O
the O

it O
was O

kept O

To O
have O

does O
not O

getting O
into O
a O

I O
have O
great O
sympathy O
with O
the O
young O
wife O
who O
does O
not O
always O
want O
to O
do O
I O
would O
not O
want O
to O
either O
, O
but O
if O
she O
wants O
to O
get O
through O
sit O
down O
quietly O
and O
make O
a O
list O
of O
everything O
she O
has O
got O
to O
do O
, O
note O
the O
order O
in O
which O
they O
can O
most O
conveniently O
be O
done O
( O
or O
must O
be O
done O
because O
of O
other O
predetermined O
factors O
- O
you O
must O
, O
for O
example O
, O
do O
your O
shopping O
on O
the B-TIME

a O

The O
Gemara B-WORK_OF_ART
continues O
with O
a O
saying O
of O
the O
Palestinian B-NORP
teacher O
, O
R. B-PER
Eleazar I-PER
( O
3rd B-DATE
Cent. I-DATE
) O
: O
' O
The O
Holy O
Spirit O
manifested O
itself O
in O
three B-CARDINAL
places O
: O
the O
court O
of O
Shem B-PER
, O
the O
court O
of O
Samuel B-PER
of I-PER
Ramah I-PER
, O
and O
the O
court O
of O
Solomon B-PER
. O

' O
The O
place O
of O
this O
on O
the O
saying O
of O
R. B-PER
Joshua I-PER
b. I-PER
Levi I-PER
which O
deals O
with O
a O
similar O
theme O
. O

One O
can O
remember O
with O
horror O
the O
pictures O
of O
the O
overcrowded O
and O
over-embellished O
drawing-rooms O
complete O
with O
heavy O
crochet O
antimacassars O
, O
mantel- O
piece O
covers O
with O
a O
fringing O
of O
clumsy O
bobbles O
and O
numerous O
other O
crocheted O
pieces O
. O

It O
was O
some B-DATE
years I-DATE
after O
the O
Victorian B-DATE
period O
that O
designers O
realised O
the O
potentialities O
of O
the O
craft O
, O
and O
crochet O
was O
revived O
with O
designs O
suitable O
for O
contemporary O
trends O
. O

Crochet O
today B-DATE
has O
a O
variety O
of O
uses O
, O
and O
has O
even O
stepped O
into O
the O
field O
of O
high O
fashion O
. O

This O
could O
hardly O
happen O
without O
the O
herring O
having O
some O
orientation O
with O
the O
sea O
bottom O
. O

It O
means O
that O
the O
crowding O
is O
caused O
during O
the O
daytime O
, O
and O
that O
the O
herring O
must O
continue O
to O
migrate O
over O
the O
ground O
as O
well O
as O
in O
midwater O
and O
during O
the O
swim O
( O
the O
swim O
at O
East B-GPE
Anglia I-GPE
Thus O
we O
can O
see O
that O
herring O
movements O
, O
although O
primarily O
are O
also O
closely O
related O
to O
the O
sea-bed O
geography O
. O

Geography O
, O
too O
, O
names O
the O
great O
fisheries O
that O
depend O
on O
them O
: O
the O
herring O
spawn O
along O
the O
northern O
In O
this O
200-fathom B-QUANTITY
trench O
the O
herring O
do O
not O
touch O
the O
bottom O
. O

Their O
descent O
stops O
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
light O
pressure O
. O

But O
they O
migrate O
easterly O
to O
the O
Norwegian B-NORP
side O
, O
or O
westerly O
, O
until O
in O
the O
shallower O
water O
the O
mile O
wide O
layers O
disappear O
from O
the O
echo-sounders O
. O

Bottom O
crowding O
comes O
when O
they O
cannot O
reach O
their O
optimum O
depth O
; O
and O
this O
coincides O
with O
the O
suitable O
gravelly O
soil O
of O
these O
many O
roughs O
where O
the O
spring- O
spawning O
herring O
are O
always O
found O
. O

and O
fishing O
gear O
leads O
to O
an O
overall O
though O
somewhat O
dim O
picture O
. O

The O
details O
are O
harder O
still O
to O
see O
. O

shoals O
that O
gather O
at O
the O
Knoll B-LOCATION
or O
other O
banks O
are O
most O
of O
them O
going O
to O
travel O
a B-QUANTITY
hundred I-QUANTITY
miles I-QUANTITY
farther O
south O
before O
they O
spawn O
. O

Some O
will O
spawn O
at O
the O
So O
the O
arrival O
of O
any O
particular O
shoal O
fish O
at O
a O
certain O
spawning O
ground O
may O
be O
accidental O
. O

Yet O
there O
will O
always O
be O
some O
that O
find O
it O
if O
enough O
are O
travelling O
, O
just O
as O
the O
robin O
who O
gets O
back O
exactly O
may O
be O
only B-CARDINAL
one I-CARDINAL
among O
thousands B-CARDINAL
who O
do O
not O
. O

But O
this O
southerly O
migration O
is O
not O
accidental O
. O

Being O
contranatant O
or O
against O
the O
drift O
, O
it O
probably O
has O
a O
survival O
value O
in O
ensuring O
that O
the O
fry O
after O
hatching O
are O
drifted O
back O
into O
the O
normal O
home O
explains O
how O
these O
migrating O
herring O
are O
biased O
to O
east O
or O
west O
by O
the O
different O
winds O
. O

Strong O
westerlies O
are O
well O
known O
to O
bring O
good O
longshore O
fishings O
. O

The O
surface O
water O
that O
is O
blown O
offshore O
must O
be O
replaced O
by O
an O
underflow O
bringing O
with O
it O
the O
herring O
to O
the O
Norfolk B-GPE
and O
Suffolk B-GPE
beaches O
. O

Easterly O
winds O
, O
on O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
recent B-DATE
years I-DATE
have O
shown O
. O

A O
succession O
of O
winds O
is O
needed O
for O
this O
effect O
of O
course O
- O
one B-CARDINAL
breeze O
will O
not O
do O
it O
, O
but O
quite O
apart O
from O
this O

there O
is O

Without O

has O

sand O
; O
or O
even O
in O
the O
case O
of O
flat O
fish O
, O
by O
vibrations O
through O
or O
along O
the O
bottom O
. O

) O
But O
given O
such O
a O
bow O
wave O
of O
disturbance O
, O
it O
is O
obvious O
that O
without O
something O
Let O
us O
consider O
first B-ORDINAL
what O
would O
appear O
to O
be O
the O
simplest O
case O
- O
that O
of O
flat O
fish O
on O
the O
bottom O
. O

The O
evidence O
suggest O
that O
the O
fish O
are O
aware O
of O
the O
moving O
footrope O
before O
it O
, O
swimming O
at O
the O
same O
speed O
for O
an O
unknown O
period O
of O
time O
, O
until O
Then O
they O
stop O
swimming O
and O
are O
caught O
. O

In O
the O
seine-net O
film O
this O
usually O
seemed O
to O
happen O
just O
after O
the O
fish O
had O
risen O
above O
the O
footrope O
, O
and O
presumably O
out O
of O
its O
field O
of O
disturbance O
, O
or O
bow O
wave O
. O

This O
suggests O
that O
the O
wave O
might O
be O
transmitted O
by O
the O
sea-bed O
, O
though O
the O
footrope O
in O
this O
case O
was O
actually O
just O
off O
the O
bottom O
and O
was O
indeed O
passing O
over O
some O
fish O
. O

Actually O
the O
seine O
net O
has O
little O
or O
no O
cover O
. O

And O
in O
this O
film O
the O
rise O
of O
the O
fish O
was O
small O
, O
a O
matter O
of O
a B-QUANTITY

two B-CARDINAL

With O
round O
fish O
like O
haddock O
, O
which O
would O
hardly O
would O
seem O
to O
be O
even O
more O
essential O
; O
but O
more O
films O
are O
needed O
to O
prove O
this O

to O
catch O
round O

whose O
reaction O
to O

would O
be O

It O

this O

Suffice O
to O
say O
that O
few O
of O
us O
stop O
to O
marvel O
at O
the O
progress O
of O
civilisation O
which O
allows O
a O
dish O
borrowed O
straight O
from O
the O
prehistoric O
. O

How O
many O
centuries O
ago O
, O
in O
some O
cave O
or O
hilly O
hide O
, O
did O
our O
forebears O
home O
from O
the O
chase O
hold O
forth O
from O
a O
spear O
the O
welcome O
gobbet O
of O
meat O
or O
fish O
burnt O
and O
roasted O
in O
the O
homely O
and O
protecting O
flame O

How O
many O
centuries O
later O
did O
the O
mercenary O
in O
the O
Roman B-NORP
wars O
thus O
impale O
on O
pike O
or O
lance O
his O
evening O
meal O

Later O
came O
the O
thrifty O
peasant O

later O
still O
the O
young O
Victorian B-NORP
buck O
adventuring O
in O
Paris B-GPE

even O
later O
our O
attractive O
young O

toying O
with O
these O
primitive O
morsels O
in O
the O
gleam O

glitter O
of O
our O
latter-day O
restaurants O

And O
, O
if O
certain O
dishes O
and O
modes O
of O
food O
have O
persisted O
down O
the O
ages O
, O
the O
motive O
that O
preserved O
always O
been O
strong O
in O
mankind O
. O

The O
sharing O
of O
a O
meal O
in O
those O
earliest O
dangerous O
days O
was O
an O
admittance O
into O
an O
acquaintanceship O
far O
more O
important O
than O
the O
casual O
meetings O
of O
the B-DATE
present I-DATE

; O
the O
desire O
to O
share O
something O
more O
intimate O
than O
mere O
converse O
has O
always O
been O
there O
. O

The O
truth O
is O
that O
good O
food O
offers O
a O
programme O
of O
entertainment O
almost O
unlimited O
in O
its O
variety O
and O
its O
presen- O

It O
was O
naturally O
a O
highly O
popular O
victory O
with O
the O
Londoners B-NORP

but O
it O
brought O
heavy O
censure O
from O

still O
believed O
that O

But O

at O

Vienne I-PER
avoided O
trouble O
at O

as O
cleverly O
as O
Du B-PER
Guesclin I-PER
avoided O
it O

Gaunt B-PER
was O
compelled O
to O
give O
up O
his O
search O
for O
an O
elusive O
foe O
, O
and O
, O
afraid O
to O
return O
home O
without O
something O
to O
show O
, O
he O
foolishly O
attempted O
to O
besiege O
the O
well-protected O
fortress O
of O
St B-GPE
Malo I-GPE

This O
involved O
the O
dreary O
method O
of O
mining O
operations O
in O
which O
Gaunt B-PER
, O
under O
the O
Black B-PER
Prince I-PER

had O
shown O
considerable O
skill O

return O
even O
despised O
failure O

The O
' O
ribald O

These O
dreary O

of O
ineffective O
fighting O
provide O
obvious O
morals O
for O
those O
who O
are O
judges O
long O
after O
the O
event O

It O
seems O
obvious O
that O
, O
though O
the O
longbows O
of O
yeomen O
could O
pierce O
the O
plate O
and O
mail O
of O
French B-NORP
knights O
, O
a O
brilliant O
battle O
was O
no O
substitute O
for O
a O
sound O
policy O
, O
and O
that O
, O
if O
archers O
had O
no O
target O
, O
campaigns O
became O
mere O
marauding O
route O
marches O
. O

It O
seems O
obvious O
that O
if O
an O
expedition O
to O
Brittany B-GPE
was O
compelled O
to O
attack O
via O
Calais B-GPE
, O
then O
the O
primary O
essential O
to O
the O
success O

of O

It O
seems O
obvious O
that O
divided O
forces O
were O
dissipating O
the O
advantages O
of O
a O
ring O
of O
bridge-heads O
which O
included O
Calais B-GPE
, O
Cherbourg B-GPE
, O
Brest B-GPE

Bordeaux B-GPE

and O
that O
there O
was O
no O
hope O

final O
victory O
without O
a O
large-scale O

concentrated O
invasion O

In O
this O
cruel O
process O
which O
was O
hammering O
out O
nations O
on O
the O
anvils O
of O

there O
was O
a O
constant O

of O
those O

find O
some O
simple O
way O
out O

in O
the O

the O
story O
of O
the O

to O
the O
Peasants' B-EVENT

In O
appreciating O
this O
story O
, O
modern O
con- O
ceptions O
of O
governmental O
duties O
must O
be O
set O
aside O
. O

A O
modern O
government O
needs O
taxation O
not O
merely O
for O
defence O
and O
offence O
but O
for O
a O
very O
wide O
range O
of O
social O
services O
. O

A O
mediaeval O
oligarchy O
needed O
taxation O
in O
order O
to O
supplement O
the O
private O
wealth O
of O
the O
monarchy O
crown O
lands O
, O
the O
fees O
of O
feudalism O
Social O
service O
as O
a O
function O
of O
government O
was O
quite O
alien O
to O
mediaeval O
thought O
- O
its O
communities O
, O
whether O
those O
communities O
were O
monasteries O
, O
manors O
, O
townships O
, O
or O
wards O
and O
guilds O
of O
a O
city O
. O

A O
mediaeval O
tax O
was O
therefore O
in O
essence O
a O
forced O
payment O
whose O
return O
was O
the O
uncertain O
bounty O
of O
booty O
and O
the O
vague O
advantages O
of O
military O
glory O
; O
it O
was O
therefore O
always O
granted O
grudgingly O
and O
coupled O
with O
the O
vain O
hope O
that O
, O
in O
the O
When O
' O
his O
' O
war O
did O
not O
bring O
victory O
and O
booty O
, O
a O

might O
oust O
the O
unsuccessful O
leaders O
, O
and O
the O
Commons B-ORG
, O
who O
usually O
supplied O
the O
hard O

might O
be O
bold O
enough O

demand O
the O
production O

and O
even O
at O
times O
the O
impeachment O
of O
the O
unsuccessful O

But O
the O

were O
not O
the O

not O

During O
the B-DATE
four- I-DATE
teenth I-DATE
century I-DATE
, O
the O
traditional O
methods O
of O
financing O
the O
Exchequer O
had O
become O
stabilized O
. O

When O
the O
King O
and O
his O
Council B-ORG
required O
additio- O
nal O
funds O
, O
they O
were O
usually O
granted O
an O
export O
tax O
on O
the O
wool O
trade O

collected O
by O
means O
of O
that O
' O
staple O
' O
system O
which O
ensured O
that O
prices O

quality O
and O

could O
be O
efficiently O
su- O
pervised O
and O
controlled O
, O
together O
with O
a O
There O
were O
two B-CARDINAL
other O
sources O
of O
public O
revenue O
- O
first B-ORDINAL
, O
the O
Church B-ORG
, O
which O
wisely O
followed O
the O
lead O
of O
the O
Commons B-ORG
and O
in O
its O
own O
Convocations O
the O
foreign O
merchants O
, O
with O
whom O
the O
King's O
officials O
had O
formerly O
made O
private O
bargains O
payments O
were O
now O
authorized O
by O

at O
a O
rate O
roughly B-PERCENT
fifty I-PERCENT
per I-PERCENT
cent I-PERCENT
in O
excess O
of O
the O
rate O
for O
native O
merchants O
. O

In O
addition O
to O
these O
revenues O
, O
the O
King O
had O
the O
financial O
benefits O
of O
his O
position O
at O
the O
head O
of O
the O
feudal O
system O
, O
as O
its O
chief O
landowner O
and O
the O
recipient O
of O
the O
fines O
of O
royal O
justice O
. O

It O
was O
, O
therefore O
, O
a O
complicated O
and O
not O
very O
satisfactory O
financial O
system O
in O
which O
the O
borders O
between O
private O
and O

were O

and O
in O
which O
the O
comparati- O
vely O
simple O
obligations O
of O
the O
feudal O
pyramid O
But O
this O
time O
there O
was O
a O
very O
interesting O
attempt O
to O
apply O
a O
sliding O
scale O
to O
the O
payments O
demanded O
. O

The O
definition O
of O
an O
adult O
was O
altered O
to O
read O
' O
over B-CARDINAL
sixteen I-CARDINAL
' O
, O
and O
, O
where O
the O

were O

, O
the O
Duke O

Lancaster B-GPE

the O

of O
Canterbury B-GPE

were O
to O
pay O
ten B-MONEY
marks I-MONEY
, O
and O
between O
these O
two B-CARDINAL
extremes O
a O
graduated O
scale O
of O
payments O
was O
fixed O
for O
the O
different O
classes O
of O
laymen O

Again O
the O
resentment O
was O
widespread O
and O
the O
results O
disappointing O
- O
a O
tax O
estimated O
to O
yield O
50,000 B-CARDINAL

raised O
only B-CARDINAL
27,000 I-CARDINAL

In O
the B-DATE
following I-DATE
year I-DATE
, O
1380 B-DATE
, O
the O
last O
and O
most O
notorious O
third B-ORDINAL
poll-tax O
was O
agreed O
by O
a O
Parliament B-ORG
which O
met O
at O
Northampton B-GPE
. O

There O
were O
dark O
reasons O
for O
a O
meeting O
so O
far O
away O
from O
the O
capital O
in O
a O
town O
with O
poor O
communications O
and O
not O

with O

London B-GPE
was O
again O
in O
turmoil O

but O
this O
time O
over O
a O
question O
of O

Kyrkby I-PER

a O

, O
was O
one O
of O
those O
charged O
with O
the O
crime O
. O

It O
is O
clear O
from O
the O
chronicles O
that O
this O
was O
a O
sordid O
quarrel O
between O
monopolists O
and O
interlopers O
. O

The O
city O

were O
jealous O
of O
foreign O

who O
could O
tempt O
court O
and O
baronage O
with O
rarer O

Trebling O
the O

was O
arrived O
at O
by O
a O
simple O
The O
only O
concession O
made O
in O
view O
of O
the O
objections O
to O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
two B-CARDINAL
poll-taxes O
was O
the O
suggestion O
that O
the O
rich O
should O
help O
the O
poor O
- O
but O
this O
was O
only O
a O
pious O
hope O
because O
no O
machinery O
was O
provided O
for O
carrying O
it O
into O
effect O

and O
a O

In O
Chapter O
Two B-CARDINAL
he O
gauged O
the O
nature O
of O
the O
heart's O
movements O
from O
the O
dissection O
of O
living O
animals O
, O
showing O
how O
these O
move- O

alternate O
with O
rests O
and O
are O
seen O
best O
in O
cold O
animals O
or O
in O
flagging O
warmer O
ones O

At O
the O
time O
of O
its O
movement O
the O
heart O
becomes O
generally O
constricted O
, O
its O
walls O
thicken O
, O
its O
ventricles O
decrease O
in O
volume O
and O
it O
expels O
its O
content O
of O
blood O

appearing O
paler O
in O
so O
doing O
in O
animals O
such O
as O
serpents O

frogs O

and O

At O
one B-CARDINAL

occur O

Harvey B-PER
noted O
that O

occur O
in O

simultaneously O
with O
dilatation O
of O

and O
expulsion O

with O
cessation O
of O

During O

of O
the O

there O
is O
often O
forcible O
expulsion O
of O
blood O
from O
the O

Arterial O
diastole O
is O
thus O
synchronous O
with O

incumbency O
I O
was O
asked O
if O
I O
would O
start O
a O
village O
choral O
society O
and O
conduct O
it O

This O
opened O
up O
a O
new O
interest O
, O
and O
we O
plunged O
into O
it O
. O

But O
what O
a O
change O
from O
the O
dear O
little O
old O
church O
at O
Tatsfield B-GPE
to O
the O
great O
modern O
church O
of O
St. B-FAC
Mark's I-FAC
at O
Purley B-GPE
. O

One O
felt O
at O
Tatsfield B-GPE
that O
, O
small O
as O
the O
had O
been O
a O
House O
of O
Prayer O
. O

I O
could O
not O
but O
feel O
the O
chilliness O
of O
the O
new O
church O
, O
beautiful O
as O
it O
was O
and O
is O
. O

When O
we O
had O
found O
a O
group O
of O
people O
who O
gladly O
co-operated O
, O
we O
made O
the O
little O
side O
chapel O
a O
place O
of O
daily O
prayer O
. O

I O
suggested O
to O
the O
congregation O
that O
it O
needed O
warming O
up O
by O
constant O
prayer O
and O
worship O
, O
and O
we O
found O
many O
to O
help O
. O

Gifts O
of O
candlesticks O
and O
stained-glass O
lancet O
windows O
- O
finally O
a O
new O
altar O
- O
helped O
to O
furnish O
the O
chapel O
as O
a O
little O
sanctuary O
for O
prayer O
and O
quiet O
. O

In O
time O
we O
received O
similar O
windows O
. O

It O
was O
very O
interesting O
to O
have O
the O
privilege O
of O
filling O
such O
a O
beautiful O
building O
with O
suitable O
fittings O
; O
I O
made O
the O
architect O
, O
himself O
a O
fine O
artist O

It O
is O
quite O
possible O
to O
put O
beautiful O
things O
into O
a O
beautiful O
church O
and O
yet O
spoil O

Though O
Lady O
Byron B-PER
knew O
perfectly O
well O
that O
Byron B-PER
, O
as O
early O
and O
it O
came O
as O
an O
appalling O
surprise O
to O
Captain O
Byron B-PER
that O
he O
had O
been O
left O
without O
the O
fortune O
that O
would O

He O
rose O
from O
his O
breakfast-nook O

came O
into O
the O

where O
Heather B-PER

Steve B-PER
stood O
aghast O
at O
his O
entrance O

He O
came O
, O
almost O
falling O
forward O
in O
an O
ungainly O
shuffle O
, O
neck O
thrust O
out O
, O
arms O
dangling O
loosely O
. O

Then O
, O
abruptly O
, O
he O
drew O
himself O
up O
and O
walked O
on O
the O
very O
tips O
of O
his O
toes O

He O
stretched O
his O

drawing-in O
great O

He O
turned O
beaming O
eyes O
upward O
and O
shook O
his O
head O
slowly O
from O
side O

Steve B-PER
awakened O
early O
and O
switched O
on O
The O
set O
lighted-up O
but O
gave O
only O
a O
low O
buzzing O
sound O
. O

He O
had O
just O
finished O
shaving O
when O
it O
came O
on O

with O
a O
flat O
voice O
repeating O
: O
" O

" O
Coming O
around O
the O
great O
mass O
of O
the O
Chateau B-FAC
Laurier I-FAC
, O
he O
braked O
to O
a O
screeching O
stop O
. O

A O
flying O
saucer O
was O
tilting O
and O
dipping O
over O
the O
War B-FAC
Memorial I-FAC

There O
was O
a O
deep O
overtone O
that O
sang O
in O
his O
ears O
with O
an O
almost O
painful O
sharpness O
. O

He O
reversed O
and O
turned O
back O
on O
McKenzie B-FAC
Avenue I-FAC
. O

" O
The O
Thetans B-NORP
, O
" O
he O
said O
, O
" O
are O
presumably O
here O
to O
take O
charge O
, O
as O
it O
were O
, O
of O
the O
minds O
of O
the O
people O
- O
who O
are O
probably O
falling O
all O
over O
them- O
selves O
in O
their O
zeal O
to O
get O
their O
orders O
and O
to O
carry O
them O
out O
. O

Just O
what O
these O
orders O
will O
be O
, O
we O
don't O
know O
. O

Now O
, O
because O
of O
prior O
hypnosis O
we O
have O
es- O
caped O
Thetan B-GPE
subjugation O
. O

This O
time O
. O

But O
we O
no O
longer O
have O
any O
immunity O
. O

There O
can O
be O
little O
doubt O
that O
if O
the O
Thetans B-NORP
discover O
our O
mental O
independence O
they O
will O
promptly O
give O
us O
their O
hypnotic O
treatment O
. O

If O
we O
can O
avoid O
undue O
prominence O
, O
it O
may O
be O
that O
we O
can O
move O
about O
pretty O
freely O
without O
detection O
. O

If O
we O
can O
- O
well O
, O
then O
we O
interests O
. O

What O
those O
interests O
are O
, O
beyond O
personal O
security O
, O
I O
haven't O
a O
clue O
; O
but O
, O
who O
knows O
, O
There O
is O
just O
a O
hope O
that O
we O
may O
uncover O
some O
weakness O
, O
and O
find O
a O
way O
of O
fighting O
back O
at O
them O
. O

" O
Heather B-PER
agreed O
, O
and O
suggested O
that O
they O
use O
Dan B-PER
as O
a O
specimen O
demonstra- O
ting O
how O
the O
Thetan B-GPE
machinations O
had O
been O
working O
out O
. O

It O
occurred O
to O
Steve B-PER
that O
this O
may O
not O
have O
been O
entirely O
an O
objective O
suggestion O
on O
her O
part O
; O
but O
he O
thought O
it O
a O
good O
idea O
So O
they O
proceeded O
to O
see O
if O
the O
coast O
was O
clear O
. O

The O
street O
was O
quiet O
and O
nor O
sound O
of O
flying O
saucers O
. O

So O
they O
ventured O
forth O
and O
made O
their O
way O
on O
foot O
to O
Dan's B-PER
house O
. O

Dan B-PER
came O
to O
the O
door O
at O
their O
ring O
but O
neglected O
to O
offer O
any O
greeting O
. O

He O
was O
deeply O
preoccupied O
, O
and O
it O
seemed O
that O
the O
ringing O
of O
a O
doorbell O
was O
to O
him O
a O
new O
and O
strange O
phenomenon O
. O

When O
he O
finally O
beckoned O
to O
them O
to O
enter O
, O
the O
action O
gave O
the O
impression O
of O
having O
been O
thought O
out O
and O
their O
heads O
like O
tennis O
spectators O
as O
he O
walked O
up O
and O
down O
, O
up O
and O
down O
. O

His O
whole O
attitude O
was O
a O
mixture O
of O
impatience O
pending O
an O
awaited O
communication O
and O
of O
a O
vague O
perplexity O
respecting O
his O
surroundings O
and O
the O
purpose O
he O
was O
to O
serve O
. O

Heather B-PER
and O
Steve B-PER
tried O
to O
make O
themselves O
at O
home O
. O

Steve B-PER
switched O
on O
Dan's B-PER
powerful O
, O
world-wide O
radio O
and O
systematically O
turned O
the O
tuning O
knob O
through O
all O

They O
followed O
him O
to O
a O
city O
bus O
stop O
on O
Carling B-FAC
Avenue I-FAC
, O
where O
he O
waited O
. O

The O
bus O
stop O
was O
a O
deserted O
island O
on O
an O
empty O
street O
. O

But O
not O
for O
long O
, O
for O
soon O
pedestrians O
and O
cars O
flocked O
upon O
the O
Avenue B-FAC
from O
its O
many O
tributary O
streets O
. O

It O
might O
have O
been O
a O
normal O
business-day O

for O
two B-CARDINAL

walked O

or O
drove O
, O
or O
waited O
as O
a O
person O
possessed O
of O
a O
single O

Then O
he O
would O
go O
back O

But O
was O
it O

I O
allowed O

the O

with O

Mr O

But O
all O

I O

Mr O
Septimus B-PER
reserved O
and O
certainly O
very O
thoughtful O
, O

that O
was O
his O
habit O

Indeed O
we O
were O
all O
invaded O
by O
a O
most O
tranquil O
mood O

Even O
the O
Indian B-NORP
servants O
relaxed O
, O
knowing O
, O
so O
Mr O

told O
us O
, O
that O
the O
wild O

tribes O
never O
approached O
this O

at O
any O

they O
remained O
with O

perhaps O
for O
such O
protection O

Mrs O
But O
after O
what O
Mrs O
Caine B-PER
had O
said O
it O
was O
never O
far O
from O
our O
minds O
that O
at O
any O
moment O
we O
were O
to O
receive O
a O
summons O
. O

I O
could O
see O
that O
Mr O
Septimus B-PER
was O
impatient O
for O
it O
. O

This B-TIME

then O
, O
we O
climbed O
a O

on O

heart O
that O
Morfydd B-PER
was O
leaving O
him O
as O
surely O
as O
she O
was O
leaving O

So O
the O

set O
out O

the O

In O
their O
flight O
from O

had O
heedlessly O
thrown O
down O
their O

Haris B-PER
had O

You O

You O

' O
Haris B-PER
growled O

' O
Why O
are O
you O
not O

' O
' O
Because O
we O
know O
all O

the O
Chief O

Suddenly O
his O
second B-ORDINAL
head O
roused O
itself O
and O
declared O
, O
' O
To O
be O
a O
good O
shape O
is O
not O
all O
in O
life O

To O
know O
is O
also O
good O

Because O
we O

well O
we O
can O

This O

of O

True B-GPE

So O
it O
lets O
us O
rule O
it O

' O
Flor B-PER

Lily-yo B-PER

together O
. O

' O
Do O
you O
say O
that O
you O
poor O
at O

' O
We O
do O

' O
' O
Then O
why O
are O
you O
captives O
? O

' O
The O
flyman O
with O
ear O
lobes O
and O

connected O
, O
making O
his O
perpetual O
little O
gesture O
of O
protest O
, O
spoke O
for O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
time O
. O

' O
To O
rule O
is O
to O

Those O
who O
bear O
power O
are O
slaves O
to O
it O

Only O
an O

Because O
we O

we O
have O

' O
' O
Go O

' O
gasped O
Flor B-PER

' O
Yes O

' O
The O
long O
afternoon B-TIME
of O
eternity O
wore O
on O
, O
that O
long O
golden O
road O
of O
an O
afternoon B-TIME
that O
would O
somewhere O
lead O
to O
everlasting O
night B-TIME
. O

Motion O
there O
was O
, O
but O
motion O
without O
event O
- O
except O
for O
those O
negligible O
events O
that O
seemed O
so O
large O
to O
the O
creatures O
participating O
in O
them O
. O

For O
Lily-yo B-PER
, O
Flor B-PER
and O
Haris B-PER
there O
were O
many O
events O
. O

Chief O
of O
these O
was O
that O
they O
learned O
to O
fly O
properly O
. O

The O
pains O
associated O
with O
their O
wings O
soon O
died O
away O
as O
the O
wonderful O
new O
flesh O
and O
tendon O
strengthened O
. O

To O
sail O
up O
in O
the O
light O
gravity O
became O
an O
increasing O
delight O
- O
the O
ugly O
flopping O
movements O
of O
flymen O
on O
the O
Heavy B-GPE
World I-GPE
had O
no O
place O
here O
. O

Alastair B-PER
was O
a O
bachelor O
. O

All O
his O
life O
he O
had O
been O
inclined O
to O
regard O
women O
as O
something O
which O
must O
necessarily O
be O
subordinated O
to O
his O
career O
. O

Now O
he O
realised O
that O
he O
was O
entrusting O
not O
only O
his O
own O
life O
, O
but O
Geoffrey's B-PER
as O
well O
, O
to O
a O
strange O
girl O
whom O
he O
had O
never O
met O
and O
on O
whom O
after O
no O
more O
than O
a O
couple O
of O
telephone O
calls O
he O
was O
It O
was O
a O
novel O
experience O
. O

Alastair B-PER
was O
quite O
unable O
to O
explain O
why O
he O
should O
feel O
so O
much O
confidence O
in O
her O
. O

Once O
again O
she O
checked O
back O
her O
instructions O
. O

It O
was O
obvious O
that O
she O
did O
not O
fail O
to O
appreciate O
the O
faith O
which O
he O
was O
placing O
in O
her O
and O
was O
prepared O
to O
accept O
the O
responsibility O
. O

evening B-TIME
- O
and O
I O
shall O
look O
forward O
to O
meeting O
you O
both O
at O
midnight B-TIME
. O

" O
They O
might O
have O
been O
arranging O
a O
supper O
party O
. O

Then O
she O
rang O
off O
. O

Alastair B-PER
admitted O
that O
never O
in O
a O
not O
altogether O
uneventful O
life O
had O
he O
come O
across O
a O
girl O
who O
sounded O
so O
charming O
and O
appeared O
to O
be O
so O
efficient O
. O

For O
some O
reason O
the O
orderlies O
had O
forgotten O
to O
switch O
on O
the O
lights O
; O
there O
was O
no O
colour O
- O
physical O
features O
were O
distinguishable O
solely O
by O
gradations O
of O
silvery O
greyness O
. O

Even O
the O
snow- O
capped O
summit O
of O
Mont B-LOCATION
Blanc I-LOCATION
, O
seven B-QUANTITY
miles I-QUANTITY
below O
, O
was O
not O
recognisable O
among O
the O
host O
of O
lower O
peaks O
. O

The O
screen O
of O
the O
air-to-air O
radar O
glowed O
. O

Occasionally O
minute O
spots O
flickered O
across O
its O
surface O
, O
but O
there O
was O
In O
the O
exceptional O
clarity O
he O
was O
even O
able O
to O
make O
a O
direct O
comparison O
between O
the O
radar O
image O
and O
the O
ground O
itself O
. O

Ahead O
lay O
the O
Plain B-LOCATION
of I-LOCATION
Lombardy I-LOCATION
; O
to O
the O
right O
, O
Turin B-GPE
; O
to O
the O
left O
, O
Milan B-GPE
. O

The O
directional O
angle O
of O
the O
scanner O
could O
be O
adjusted O
to O
cover O
any O
particular O
area O
within O
its O
range O
. O

Geoffrey B-PER
ground O
immediately O
ahead O
. O

He O
was O
able O
to O
pick O
out O
towns O
, O
unrecognisable O
to O
the O
naked O
eye O
, O
obscured O
by O
the O
ground O
haze O
which O
even O
on O
the O
clearest O
night B-TIME
limited O
angular O
vision O
. O

He O
glanced O
at O
the O
speed O
recorder O
. O

It O
seemed O
almost O
incredible O
that O
the O
tiny O
white O
figure O
of O
8.5 B-CARDINAL
against O
which O
the O
needle O
was O
resting O
could O
really O
mean O
hundreds B-QUANTITY
of I-QUANTITY
knots I-QUANTITY
. O

Now O
, O
as O
Alastair B-PER
reduced O
the O
thrust O
, O
the O
pitch O
changed O
as O
the O
nose O
of O
the O
aircraft O
dipped O
slightly O
. O

The O
needle O
of O
the O
speed O
before O
coming O
to O
rest O
at O
5.0 B-CARDINAL
. O

" O
We O
're O
a O
bit O
smiled O
. O

Alastair B-PER
talked O
of O
running O
in O
when O
they O
were O
still O
more B-QUANTITY
than I-QUANTITY
four I-QUANTITY
hundred I-QUANTITY
miles I-QUANTITY
from O
their O
destination O
. O

They O
were O
nearing O
Modena B-GPE
. O

Geoffrey B-PER
focused O
the O
radar O
scanner O
by O
special O
helicopter O
from O
the O
Horse B-FAC
Guards I-FAC
Geoffrey B-PER
set O
himself O
to O
consider O
the O
movements O
of O
the O
Bentley B-PRODUCT
. O

It O
had O
passed O
him O
at O
the O
temporary O
bridge O
over O
the O
Tartaro B-LOCATION
at O
a B-TIME
few I-TIME
minutes I-TIME
past I-TIME
ten I-TIME
on O
the B-TIME
previous I-TIME
night I-TIME
. O

He O
worked O
out O
the O
distance O
on O
the O
presumption O
that O
its O
route O
had O
been O
through O
Florence B-GPE
and O
Rome B-GPE
and O
then O
across O
Italy B-GPE
via O
Foggia B-GPE
to O
Barletta B-GPE
. O

It O
came O
to O
just B-QUANTITY
over I-QUANTITY
six I-QUANTITY
hundred I-QUANTITY
miles I-QUANTITY
. O

To O
Beryl B-PER
, O
at O
least O
, O
this O
was O
anti-climax O
with O
a O
vengeance O
. O

She O
had O
expected O
to O
be O
met O
with O
violent O
reproaches O
- O
and O
here O
he O
was O
bland O
and O
smiling O
. O

But O
it O
did O
not O
take O
her O
long O
to O
realise O
that O
his O
mood O
was O
less O
pleasant O
than O
appeared O
on O
the O
surface O
. O

He O
told O
her O
nonchalantly O
, O
as O
he O
led O
the O
way O
to O
his O
own O
veranda O
, O
that O
he O
had O
taken O
the O
liberty O
of O
asking O
Jack B-PER
- O
as O
a O
representative O
of O
the O
Vallin B-PER
family O
- O
to O
come O
over O
and O
make O
the O
presentation O
in O
her O
stead O
. O

" O
I O
caught O
him O
just O
as O
he O
was O
going O
to O
the O
of O
fact O
I O
'd O
asked O
him O
last B-TIME
night I-TIME
to O
deputise O
for O
me O
and O
fetch O
her O
. O

He O
brought O
her O
to O
the O
party O
said O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
thing O
that O
came O
into O
her O
head O
. O

had O
had O
a O
thoroughly O
good O
time O
, O
and O
it O
would O
take O
them O
nearly O
to O
next B-DATE
week I-DATE
to O
settle O
down O
again O
. O

Meanwhile O
Hubert B-PER
would O
have O
betaken O
himself O
and O
his O
well- O
It O
was O
all O
over O
and O
done O
with O
. O

For O
the O
time O
being O
Beryl B-PER
was O
content O
to O
let O
it O
go O
at O
that O
, O
but O
she O
resolved O
to O
have O
it O
out O
with O
Piers B-PER
when O
a O
reasonable O
opportunity O
presented O
itself O
. O

He O
must O
learn O
that O
he O
could O
not O
treat O
her O
with O
injustice O
and O
contempt O
, O
ignoring O
her O
explanations O
as O
though O
he O
were O
a O
schoolmaster O
and O
she O
a O
small O
, O
ignorant O
child O
. O

He O
gave O
her O
no O
chance O
of O
any O
private O
conversation O
that B-TIME
evening I-TIME
, O
for O
when O
Blanche B-PER
and O
Jack B-PER
left O
, O
he O
went O
with O
them O
. O

But O
next B-TIME
morning I-TIME
she O
insisted O
on O
his O
taking O
her O
out O
in O
the O
jeep B-PRODUCT
- O
to O
find O
, O
if O
possible O
, O
Hubert B-PER
and O
his O
her O
great O
disappointment O
at O
being O
held O
up O
in O
Balicou B-GPE
. O

With O
an O
air O
of O
resignation O
he O
sent O
Judy B-PER
, O
his O
Boxer O
, O
to O
the O
back O
, O
and O
made O
room O
for O
her O
beside O
him O
. O

" O
Is O
that O
all O
you O
want O
to O
do O
? O

" O
he O
asked O
, O
letting O
in O
the O
clutch O
. O

" O
No O
; O
I O
want O
to O
make O
you O
understand O
just O
what O
happened O
about O
this O
Balicou B-GPE
trip O
, O
" O
she O
returned O
coldly O
. O

" O
I O
'm O
a O
little O
tired O
of O
being O
treated O
like O
an O
ineffective O
imbecile O
. O

" O
" O
And O
I O
'm O
heartily O
sick O
of O
being O
constantly O
called O
to O
account O
for O
my O
manners O
, O
" O
he O
retorted O
. O

" O
What O
have O
I O
done O
wrong O
now O
? O

I O
cover O
up O
for O
you O
the O
best O
way O
I O
can O
by O
getting O
hold O
of O
Jack B-PER
to O
make O
the O
presentation O
, O
I O
run O
the O
damned O
party O
to O
the O
best O
of O
my O
ability O
- O
saying O
the O
sugary O
things O
you O
ought O
to O
have O
been O
there O
fault O
. O

" O
look O
as O
though O
it O
was O
only O
what O
you O
expected O
of O
me O
, O
and O
his O
pals O
down O
. O

" O
to O
understand O
all O
the O
whys O
and O
wherefores O
of O
your O
actions O
, O
" O
he O
said O
stiffly O
. O

" O
Still O
less O
to O
criticise O
you O
. O

" O
" O
Oh O
, O
drop O
that O
nonsense O
, O
Piers B-PER
! O

Be O
yourself O
, O
" O
she O
exclaimed O
, O
with O
mounting O
exasperation O
. O

" O
Very O
well O
! O

" O
He O
brought O
the O
jeep B-PRODUCT
to O
a O
standstill O
in O
a O
rough O
path O
fringed O
and O
shaded O
by O
citrus O
trees O
. O

" O
If O
you O
want O
my O
true O
opinion O
I O
'll O
give O
it O
. O

You O
made O
some O
sort O
of O
a O
protest O
to O
Graybury B-ORG
. O

I O
'll O
give O
you O
credit O
for O
that O
. O

But O
you O
didn't O
press O
the O
matter O
because O
, O
very O
naturally O
, O
you O
were O
thoroughly O
enjoying O
Forrest's B-PER
company O
in O
idyllic O
surroundings O
. O

" O
" O
How O
dare O
you O
say O
such O
a O
thing O
? O

" O
she O
blazed O
. O

" O
For O
goodness' O
sake O
show O
a O
glimmer O
of O
reason O
, O
" O
was O
his O
equally O
indignant O
rejoinder O
. O

" O
I O
know O
. O

Absurd O
as O
it O
may O
seem O
, O
I O
didn't O
want O
you O
to O
think O
badly O
of O
me O
. O

" O
She O
turned O
away O
from O
him O
to O
fondle O
Judy B-PER
, O
who O
, O
sensing O
something O
amiss O
, O
was O
nudging O
her O
in O
the O
endeavour O
to O
if O
I O
had O
absolutely O
insisted O
on O
sailing O
at O
the O
have O
had O
it O
in O
for O
Guy B-PER
. O

You O
see O
, O
it O
was O
, O
apparently O
, O
through O
a O
mistake O
on O
Guy's B-PER
part O
that O
we O
missed O
seeing O
the O
flamingoes O
our O
first B-ORDINAL
morning B-TIME
on O
the O
island O
. O

" O
" O
What O
harm O
could O
possibly O
have O
come O
to O
Forrest B-PER
through O
Sir O
John's B-PER
nonsense O
? O

" O
Piers B-PER
could O
hardly O
have O
spoken O
with O
more O
contempt O
. O

A O
bully O
like O
that O
respects O
anyone O
who O
dares O
to O
stand O
up O
to O
him O
. O

" O
Beryl B-PER
tried O
to O
suppress O
the O
thought O
that O
this O
was O
precisely O
the O
remark O
she O
had O
made O
to O
Guy B-PER
. O

your O
knowledge O
of O
all O
the O
affairs O
of O
the O
island O
I O
needn't O
tell O
you O
that O
Sir O
John B-PER
Graybury I-PER
is O
one O
of O
Mr. O
Hewson's B-PER
most O
important O
customers O
. O

" O
" O
So O
what O
? O

You O
're O
not O
Forrest B-PER
for O
behaving O
with O
ordinary O
moral O
courage O
! O

He O
's O
quite O
capable O
of O
telling O
Sir O
John B-PER
to O
take O
himself O
and O
his O
business O
to O
an O
unmention- O
able O
destination O
. O

" O
" O
There O
's O
a O
difference O
between O
what O
a O
senior O
and O
a O
junior O
partner O
can O
do O
, O
" O
was O
her O
quick O
reply O
. O

" O
What O
they O
can O
bring O
off O
! O

I O
'll O
admit O
that O
. O

But O
Forrest B-PER
might O
at O
least O
have O

But O
if O

But O
I O
reckon O
they O
'll O
be O
too O
busy O
shooting O
at O
us O
to O
bother O
with O
the O

the O
folks O
in O
it O

" O
" O
Maybe O
, O
" O
I O
said O

" O
But O
we O
've O
got O
to O
remember O
that O
girl O
all O
the O
time O

Dan B-PER

I O
feel O
kind O
of O
responsible O
for O
her O

" O
" O
Of O
course O
, O
" O
he O
said O
, O
giving O
me O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
his O
strange O
looks O
. O

Then O
he O
and O
have O
a O
look O
at O
the O
mining O
camp O
. O

working O
for O
, O
as O
well O
as O
the O
townsfolk O
and O
the O
agency O
detective O
. O

" O
With O
something O
of O
a O
start O
I O
remembered O
the O
man O
who O
'd O
brought O
us O
into O
this O
business O
. O

" O
Maybe O
you O
don't O
know O
about O
Appleton B-PER
, O
I O
said O
. O

I O
watched O
him O
because O
I O
was O
always O
fascinated O
by O
the O
way O
he O
looked O
when O
you O
tried O
to O
surprise O
him O
. O

" O
Dead O
? O

" O
he O
said O
. O

" O
Yes O
. O

Dead O
. O

Shuffled O
out O
of O
the O
deck O
. O

Blasted O
down O
with O
a O
shotgun O
outside O
the O
Palace B-FAC
last B-TIME
night I-TIME
. O

" O
" O
Fenton B-PER
or O
Somers B-PER
, O
" O
he O
said O
. O

" O
Or O
the O
Town O
Marshal O
, O
" O
I O
added O
. O

His O
face O
was O
fixed O
, O
his O
horse O
back O
off O
the O
trail O
and O
up O
the O
slope O
leading O
to O
the O
ridge O
. O

I O
followed O
. O

From O
the O
top O
you O
could O
see O
something O
of O
the O
wild O
hill O
country O
that O
lay O
all O
round O
Gilburg B-FAC
Crossing I-FAC
. O

The O
air O
was O
fresh O
and O
clear O
and O
you O
could O
see O
far O
over O
west O
and O
north O
for O
many B-QUANTITY
miles I-QUANTITY
. O

The O
real O
high O
country O
of O
the O
Rockies B-LOCATION
lifted O
up O
in O
the O
distance O
like O
a O
pale O
water- O
colour O
drawing O
. O

Between O
us O
and O
that O
lay O
a O
vast O
stretch O
of O
hills O
, O
canyons O
, O
buttes O
and O
malpais O
. O

said O
Dan B-PER
. O

" O
If O
we O
head O
west O
we O
ought O
to O
cut O
the O
trail O
leading O
from O
Gilburg B-GPE
to O
the O
north O
. O

" O
So O
we O
swung O
west O
, O
making O
slow O
going O
over O
rough O
country O
, O
sliding O
on O
shale O
, O
climbing O
down O
into O
draws O
, O
circling O
a O
big O
mesa O
by O
a O
four B-QUANTITY
or I-QUANTITY
five I-QUANTITY
mile I-QUANTITY
valley O
, O
sandy-floored O
. O

It O
got O
hotter O
as O
the O
day O
wore O
on O
and O
we O
rested O
gratefully O
by O
a O
small O
creek O
where O
we O
watered O
the O
horses O
and O
drank O
enough O
to O
cure O
our O
thirst O
. O

An O
hour's B-TIME
riding O
brought O
us O
to O
a O
trail O
that O
We O
turned O
north O
into O
it O
and O
after O
about B-QUANTITY
four I-QUANTITY
miles I-QUANTITY
it O
led O
into O
a O
small O
canyon O
which O
opened O
out O
into O
a O
wide O
shallow O
draw O
. O

Here O
in O
a O
dried-up O
creek-bed O
we O
found O
the O
miners O
at O
work O
. O

They O
were O
scattered O
over O
a O
fairly O
wide O
area O
working O
singly O
or O
of O
the O
diggings O
there O
was O
a O
roughly-built O
shack O
and O
as O
we O
got O
near O
someone O
inside O
bawled O
out O
, O
" O
If O
you O
come O
any O
closer O
, O
I O
'll O
sure O
blow O
your O
whiskers O
off O
. O

" O
" O
Take O
it O
easy O
, O
mister O
, O
" O
I O
sang O
got O
no O
whiskers O
so O
as O
you O
can O
see O
. O

Just O
you O
go O
and O
tell O
Nick B-PER
Dowd I-PER
we O
've O
come O
to O
talk O
to O
him O
about O
what O
happened O
last B-TIME
night I-TIME
. O

" O
whistle O
then O
, O
loud O
and O
shrill O
. O

The O
gun O
barrel O
peeking O
out O
through O
a O
hole O
in O
the O
shack O
never O
wavered O
. O

We O
sat O
our O
horses O
, O
waiting O
. O

" O
Looks O
as O
though O
they O
're O
expecting O
trouble O
, O
" O
I O
said O
. O

" O
Where O
observed O
Dan B-PER
, O
shifting O
about O
in O
his O
saddle O
. O

He O
was O
never O
long O
on O
patience O
. O

Mr. O
Copthorne B-PER
knew O
a O
way O
round O
by O
the O
side O
of O
the O
church O
where O
there O
was O
a O
small O
open O
outbuilding O
where O
the O
grave O
digger O
kept O
his O
spades O
and O
forks O
and O
tidying O
up O
implements O
. O

It O
might O
be O
open O
. O

It O
was O
. O

He O
entered O
, O
and O
seated O
himself O
in O
a O
huddle O
upon O
an O
upturned O
wheelbarrow O
. O

His O
curious O
headgear O
fell O
off O
. O

Strange O
things O
were O
going O
on O
in O
his O
bewildered O
brain O
. O

When O
a O
man O
was O
drowning O
and O
towards O
his O
last O
gasp O
it O
was O
scientifically O
supposed O
his O
whole O
life O
came O
up O
before O
him O
in O
some O
cinematic O
outbuilding O
, O
but O
this O
was O
happening O
to O
him O
now O
. O

He O
saw O
himself O
as O
a O
sulky O
, O
ugly O
, O
malformed O
, O
repressed O
boy O
, O
then O
a O
young O
youth O
. O

He O
saw O
himself O
refusing O
baptism O
according O
to O
the O
sect O
his O
parents O
belonged O
to O
. O

on O
, O
his O
leaping O
mind O
flashed O
pictures O
of O
chi- O
canery O
and O
corruption O
, O
the O
growth O
of O
the O
dea- O
dly O
decadence O
and O
absorption O
in O
debase- O
ment O
and O
Satanic O
debauchery O
. O

He O
didn't O
know O
what O
to O
make O
of O
it O
, O
but O
it O
was O
Mr. O
Copthorne B-PER
all O
right O
. O

Perhaps O
he O
had O
been O
attending O
some O
kind O
of O
fancy O
dress O
do O
in O
London B-GPE
. O

Very O
strange O
his O
eyes O
looked O
. O

Mad O
, O
hunted O
eyes O
, O
as O
if O
the O
poor O
fellow O
had O
rocks O
in O
his O
head O
, O
so O
the O
verger O
described O
afterwards O
. O

speak O
normally O
. O

" O
Yes O
. O

I O
travelled O
down O
from O
London B-GPE
as O
the O
dawn O
was O
breaking O
, O
and O
led O
the O
way O
in O
. O

" O
The O
stained O
glass O
There O
were O
few O
passengers O
on O
the O
plane O
and O
Gavin B-PER
was O
quickly O
through O
the O
customs O
. O

" O
Gay B-PER
! O

" O
" O
Gavin B-PER
! O

" O
The O
girl O
and O
her O
luggage O
had O
disappeared O
and O
they O
were O
alone O
together O
. O

The O
porter O
brought O
Gavin's B-PER
bag O
out O
to O
the O
hand O
and O
smiled O
. O

" O
I O
want O
to O
check O
up O
on O
the O
flights O
back O
. O

" O
Gay B-PER
went O
out O
to O
the O
waiting O
taxi O
, O
and O
then O
found O
that O
in O
the O
excitement O
of O
meeting O
Gavin B-PER
she O
had O
left O
her O
sun- O
glasses O
on O
the O
veranda O
. O

She O
went O
quickly O
back O
to O
fetch O
them O
. O

Gavin B-PER
and O
the O
girl O
who O
had O
got O
off O
the O
plane O
with O
him O
were O
talking O
. O

He O
was O
writing O
something O
in O
his O
pocket-book O
, O
with O
a O
sick O
feeling O
of O
despair O
Gay B-PER
knew O
that O
of O
course O
" O
And O
then O
we O
'll O
go O
for O
a O
stroll O
along O
the O
beach O
. O

A O
moon B-LOCATION
like O
this O
mustn't O
be O
wasted O
. O

" O
He O
gestured O
towards O
the O
bay O
where O
the O
full O
moon B-LOCATION
was O
just O
rising O
over O
the O
rocks O
, O
then O
laid O
his O
hand O
on O
hers O
. O

Gay B-PER
smiled O
at O
him O
only O
, O
yet O
remembering O
for O
a B-TIME
second I-TIME
the O
kisses O
she O
had O
seen O
him O
giving O
Elaine B-PER
. O

All O
that O
was O
part O
of O
the O
past O
, O
she O
would O
put O
it O
behind O
her O
. O

She O
would O
never O
be O
jealous O
again O
, O
would O
even O
take O
Larry's B-PER
advice O
and O
look O
the O
other O
way O
if O
need O
be O
. O

" O
I O
say O
! O

" O
Gavin B-PER
was O
looking O
over O
her O
shoulder O
. O

" O
That O
's O
a O
pretty O
girl O
! O

" O
Gay B-PER
glanced O
behind O
her O
, O
" O
Isn't O
she O
Gay B-PER
, O
a O
little O
puzzled O
, O
went O
through O
to O
the O
bar O
. O

Doc B-PER
and O
Lilyan B-PER
were O
sitting O
just O
inside O
having O
coffee O
. O

" O
Come O
and O
join O
us O
and O
bring O
your O
Lilyan B-PER
remonstrated O
. O

" O
They O
want O
to O
be O
tonight B-TIME
so O
come O
and O
join O
us O
if O
you O
Gay B-PER
thanked O
him O
and O
walked O
out O
on O
to O
the O
terrace O
thinking O
that O
perhaps O
Gavin B-PER
had O
bought O
a O
drink O
and O
taken O
it O
outside O
. O

She O
looked O
round O
scanning O
the O
tables O
, O
then O
caught O
her O
breath O
, O
a O
cold O
hand O
seeming O
to O
clutch O
her O
heart O
. O

Gavin B-PER
was O
seated O
at O
a O
small O
table O
in O
a O
shadowy O
corner O
talking O
animatedly O
to O
Simone B-PER
. O

As O
Gay B-PER
watched O
he O
offered O
the O
girl O
a O
cigarette O
and O
lit O
it O
, O
his O
hands O
cupping O
Gay B-PER
stood O
irresolute O
for O
a O
moment O
, O
half B-CARDINAL
decided O
to O
go O
back O
and O
join O
Lilyan B-PER
and O
Doc B-PER
, O
while O
she O
wanted O
to O
do O
no O
more O
than O
run O
upstairs O
to O
her O
room O
, O
knowing O
that O
Gavin B-PER
although O
he O
had O
told O
her O
that O
he O
loved O
her O
, O
was O
already O
flirting O
with O
a O
girl O
that O
he O
had O
only O
met O
a B-TIME
few I-TIME
minutes I-TIME
before O
. O

but O
she O
turned O
away O
, O
giving O
a O
little O
gesture O
of O
hopelessness O
, O
knowing O
that O
her O
The O
others O
were O
all O
dancing O
and O
as O
Gay B-PER
drew O
out O
a O
chair O
and O
sat O
down O
Gavin B-PER
, O
without O
a O
word O
, O
swept O
Simone B-PER
on O
to O
the O
floor O
. O

" O
It O
doesn't O
mean O
anything O
, O
" O
Gay B-PER
told O
herself O
desperately O
, O
view O
and O
remembering O
the O
advice O
that O
Larry B-PER
had O
given O
her O
, O
while O
she O
felt O
wretched O
beyond O
words O
. O

His O
behaviour O
was O
not O
only O
boorish O
and O
in O
the O
worst O
of O
taste O
but O
it O
was O
unkind O
beyond O
words O
. O

She O
fumbled O
with O
the O
cigarette O
packet O
which O
lay O
on O
the O
table O
not O
wanting O
to O
smoke O
but O
needing O
some O
action O
to O
help O
her O
control O
her O
feelings O
. O

" O
Come O
and O
lifeline O
and O
Gay B-PER
got O
up O
quickly O
, O
mana- O
ging O
a O
smile O
. O

As O
he O
swung O
her O
on O
to O
the O
floor O
Gay B-PER
saw O
Gavin B-PER
and O
Simone B-PER
go O
through O
the O
doorway O
that O
led O
down O
to O
the O
beach O
. O

Gay B-PER
closed O
her O
eyes O
for O
a O
moment O
in O
disgust O
. O

She O
was O
fully O
aware O
that O
Gavin B-PER
would O
make O
love O
to O
the O
French B-NORP
girl O
on O
the O
sands O
, O
and O
no O
doubt O
he O
would O
come O
back O
soon O
and O
after O
Simone B-PER
had O
left O
expect O
her O
to O
accept O
his O
kisses O
on O
the O
way O
back O
to O
the O
hotel O
. O

heart O
out O
over O
? O

" O
Doc B-PER
nodded O
towards O
the O
door O
. O

" O
You O
may O
consider O
him O
a O
man O
, O
I O
would O
say O
he O
was O
a O
weakly O
, O
" O
you O
don't O
know O
Gavin B-PER
. O

" O
" O
I O
've O
only O
met O
him O
today B-DATE
but O
I O
think O
I O
can O
safely O
say O
that O
I O
know O
him O
a O
great O
deal O
better O
than O
you O
do O
. O

" O
Doc B-PER
gave O
her O
hand O
a O
shake O
. O

" O
Wake O
up O
Gay B-PER
, O
and O
don't O
even O
contemplate O
throwing O
yourself O
away O
on O
a O
chap O
like O
that O
. O

You O
're O
a O
fine O
girl O
, O
intelligent O
, O
and O
pretty O
, O
and O
I O
had O
thought O
you O
were O
sensible O
too O
. O

Don't O
make O
a O
fool O
of O
yourself O
over O
someone O
who O
doesn't O
care O
two B-CARDINAL
jots O
for O
your O
feelings O
. O

If O
he O
behaves O
like O
this O
now O
what O
is O
your O
married O
life O
going O
to O
be O
like O
? O

Doc B-PER
asked O
Lilyan B-PER
to O
dance O
and O
once O
again O
Gay B-PER
found O
herself O
alone O
at O
the O
table O
feeling O
self-conscious O
and O
awkward O
, O
sure O
that O
people O
were O
talking O
about O
the O
way O
Gavin B-PER
was O
behaving O
since O
they O
had O
seen O
them O
dining O
together O
. O

She O
opened O
her O
bag O
to O
get O
out O
her O
compact O
and O
saw O
Grace's B-PER
letter O
. O

She O
drew O
it O
out O
and O
opened O
it O
, O
glad O
to O
be O
able O
to O
occupy O
herself O
. O

" O
So O
glad O
that O
you O
are O
having O
such O
a O
lovely O
time O
, O
dearie O
, O
" O
and O
have O
been O
over O
to O
sit O
with O
her O
father O
and O
do O
what O
I O
can O
for O
him O
so O
that O
she O
can O
get O
out O
to O
do O
her O
shopping O
. O

He O
's O
getting O
on O
well O
but O
is O
pretty O
helpless O
still O
with O
his O
and O
going O
to O
marry O
a O
foreigner O
... O
" O
it O
back O
in O
her O
bag O
. O

Elaine B-PER
was O
engaged O
, O
to O
the O
man O
she O
had O
spent O
so O
much O
time O
with O
at O
her O
party O
. O

That O
was O
why O
Gavin B-PER
had O
come O
back O
to O
her O
. O

Everything O
was O
quite O
clear O
now O
, O
and O
to O
her O
own O
surprise O
Gay B-PER
felt O
no O
heartbreak O
, O
rather O
a O
sense O
of O
relief O
now O
that O
she O
knew O
why O
Gavin B-PER
had O
come O
to O
see O
her O
. O

understand O
, O
knowing O
that O
Gay B-PER
was O
as O
much O
ashamed O
for O
Gavin B-PER
at O
the O
way O
he O
was O
behaving O
as O
she O
was O
hurt O
for O
herself O
. O

" O
There O
are O
all O
sorts O
of O
wonder- O
ful O
jobs O
in O
London B-GPE
and O
I O
could O
one O
has O
to O
know O
something O
about O
fishing O
and O
in O
Liverpool B-GPE
they O
'd O
want O
sea-farers O

I O
don't O
think O
I O
'd O
go O
to O
Edinburgh B-GPE
un- O
less O
I O
was O
a O
Scot B-NORP

wanting O
to O
get O
home O
, O
or O
perhaps O
a O
student O
studying O
to O
be O
a O
doctor O
, O
and O
I O
already O

all O
about O
that O
. O

" O
She O
was O
engaged O
to O
Nigel B-PER
, O
had O
been O
for O
two B-DATE
years I-DATE

Sometimes O
they O
talked O
on O
the O
theme O
of O
" O
when O
we O
get O
married O
" O
, O
and O
then O
all O
was O
wonderful O
, O
and O
perhaps O
it O
had O
only O
been O
a O
slip O
of O
the O
tongue O
when O
Nigel B-PER
had O
said O

only O
last B-TIME

lark O

I O
can O
tell O
you O
! O

" O
word O
shouted O
into O
her O
very O
soul O
a O
horn O
of O
warning O
, O
and O
with O
it O
was O
coupled O
a O
disembodied O
fragment O
of O
information O
, O
seen O
in O
Farlingham B-GPE
on O
an O
occasion O
he O
had O
sworn O
he O
had O
been O
standing O
in O
for O
Luke B-PER
Parsons I-PER
at O
his O
surgery O
in O
Little B-GPE
Phelpham I-GPE
. O

Now O
Nigel B-PER
had O
every O
right O
to O
go O
where O
he O
when O
she O
was O
not O
free O
; O
this O
much O
they O
had O
conceded O
one O
to O
the O
other O
. O

They O
rarely O
found O
they O
were O
off O
duty O
together O
, O
and O
the O
situation O
would O
have O
been O
intolerable O
about O
their O
relationship O
. O

So O
when O
Nigel B-PER
had O
told O
her O
about O
taking O
Luke's B-PER
evening B-TIME
surgery O
she O
had O
said O
, O
he O
shrugged O
diffidently O
, O
" O
I O
like O
the O
work O
. O

One O
gets O
plenty O
of O
variety O
and O
it O
's O
a O
change O
. O

" O
Nigel B-PER
was O
the O
hospital's O
Junior O
Medical O
Officer O
. O

" O
You O
won't O
be O
free O
about B-CARDINAL
nine I-CARDINAL
, O
I O
suppose O
, O
to O
meet O
me O
for O
supper O
somewhere O
? O

" O
she O
had O
asked O
hopefully O
. O

" O
Hardly O
likely O
, O
my O
sweet O
. O

Luke's B-PER
surgery O
goes O
on O
for O
hours B-TIME
. O

If O
they O
get O
in O
before O
eight-thirty B-CARDINAL
, O
even O
though O
they O
're O
standing O
on O
one O
another's O
toes O
, O
I O
'll O
give O
you O
a O
ring O
, O
O.K. O
? O

" O
O.K. O
, O
" O
she O
had O
replied O
readily O
. O

So O
how O
could O
Nigel B-PER
have O
been O
at O
the O
Load B-FAC
of I-FAC
Trouble I-FAC
roadhouse O
, O
very B-TIME
evening I-TIME
? O

" O
No O
, O
" O
she O
told O
Phil B-PER
Gubbins I-PER
, O
a O
junior O
my O
lad O
. O

" O
" O
It O
was O
Nigel's B-PER
car O
, O
anyway O
. O

NUF O
121 B-CARDINAL
. O

" O
" O
He O
probably O
loaned O
his O
car O
to O
somebody O
, O
Phil B-PER
. O

He O
's O
always O
doing O
that O
. O

" O
Young O
Gubbins B-PER
shrugged O
. O

" O
I O
didn't O
see O
his O
face O
, O
Di B-PER
, O
but O
it O
certainly O
looked O
like O
Nigel B-PER
from O
the O
back O
. O

D.j. O
and O
all O
. O

Of O
course O
such O
as O
I O
couldn't O
afford O
to O
go O
into O
the O
Load B-FAC
of I-FAC
Trouble I-FAC
. O

" O
" O
5Ye-es O
? O

" O
he O
lowered O
his O
eyes O
and O
kissed O
her O
on O
the O
mouth O
, O
an O
act O
of O
devotion O
he O
didn't O
over-indulge O
. O

" O
What O
about O
it O
, O
my O
sweet O
? O

" O
" O
Well O
, O
" O
she O
laughed O
suddenly O
in O
an O
upsurging O
of O
relief O
, O
" O
that O
stupid O
Gubbins B-PER
boy O
thought O
he O
saw O
you O
at O
the O
Load B-FAC
of I-FAC
Trouble I-FAC
. O

With O
a O
blonde O
, O
too O
. O

Imagine O

" O
Nigel B-PER
was O
frowning O
. O

He O
looked O
distinguished O
when O
he O
frowned O
; O
boyishly O
Though O
Diana B-PER
knew O
the O
name O
of O
every O
member O
of O
the O
staff O
, O
distinguished O
or O
not O
, O
Nigel B-PER
often O
had O
to O
think O
hard O
to O
sort O
he O
now O
demanded O
. O

" O
What O
was O
he O
about O
serious O
things O
like O
engagements O
. O

" O
" O
Don't O
be O
such O
a O
baby O
! O

" O
They O
were O
going O
Almost O
in O
desperation O
she O
appealed O
, O
" O
Will O
you O
meet O
me O
at O
the O
gate O
, O
four B-TIME
o'clock I-TIME
tomorrow I-TIME
? O

" O
" O
Why O
? O

" O
he O
he O
told O
her O
, O
and O
suddenly O
seized O
her O
in O
an O
embrace O
which O
really O
hurt O
. O

" O
Without O
your O
ring O
it O
's O
just O
like O
and O
kissed O
her O
again O
, O
somewhat O
startled O
to O
what O
you O
'd O
get O
, O
" O
she O
flashed O
at O
him O
, O
and O
so O
had O
left O
him O
, O
on O
her O
dignity O
and O
not O
seeing O
the O
look O
of O
admiration O
and O
revelation O
which O
had O
followed O
her O
slim O
young O
figure O
then O
regarded O
the O
ring O
which O
he O
retrieved O
with O
some O
bitterness O
