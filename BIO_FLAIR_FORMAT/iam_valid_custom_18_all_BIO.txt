in O
the B-DATE

of I-DATE
1934 I-DATE
, O
the O
German B-NORP
ambassador O

" O

in O

A O
90-day B-DATE
war O
, O
the O
West B-NORP
German I-NORP
view O

provides O
the O
pretext O
for O
huge O

In O

After O
much O

the O
British B-ORG

these O

Now O
this O

Herr O

All O
this O
has O
been O

But O
a O
big O
role O

been O
played O
not O
only O
by O
the O
British B-ORG

by O
Right-Wing B-ORG

They O
have O

Now O
the O
argument O

being O

stay O

it O

Today B-DATE

again O

article O

for O

as O
president O
of O

the O

at O
the O
Scar- B-EVENT

I O
am O
appalled O
at O
the O
character O
of O
the O
current O
For O
many B-DATE
years I-DATE
my O
union O
had O
to O
present O
its O
views O
to O
the O
two B-CARDINAL
major O
conferences O
of O
the O
movement O
and O
take O
a O
licking O
. O

For O
us O
, O
unity O
meant O
accepting O
unpalatable O
majority O
decisions O
as O
binding O
on O
the O
movement O
and O
having O
a O
go O
next O
time O
. O

Alongside O
many O
others O
, O
we O
conducted O
our O
fight O
by O
putting O
down O
 O
unambiguous O
alternatives O
to O
official O
policy O
and O
seeking O
to O
win O
majorities O
for O
them O
. O

For O
we O
have O
always O
felt O
, O
even O
if O
we O
have O
then O
by O
our O
practice O
ignored O
it O
, O
the O
inconsistency O
between O
support O
for O
the O
war O
alliance O
, O
with O
resulting O
colossal O
spending O
on O
armaments O
, O
and O
our O
basic O
effort O
to O
improve O
living O
standards O
. O

Instead O
, O
we O
saw O
the O
Gaitskellites B-NORP
using O
the O
position O
of O
organisational O
dominance O
established O
during O
their O
years O
It O
would O
become O
easy O
to O
become O
cynical O
and O
to O
despair O
. O

And O
yet O
, O
wherever O
the O
issues O
were O
put O
clearly O
, O
sections O
of O
the O
movement O
reaffirmed O
their O
original O
stand O
. O

Only O
where O
the O
issues O
were O
posed O
so O
as O
to O
cause O
doubt O
and O
confusion O
were O
positions O
lost O
. O

It O
is O
my O
view O
that O
this O
immediate O
confusion O
hides O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
Peace B-ORG
movement I-ORG
is O
still O
advancing O
and O
that O
clarification O
of O
the O
issues O
can O
bring O
a O
majority O
to O
 O
secure O
the O
Scarborough B-GPE
decisions O
. O

Powerful O
units O
have O
stood O
firm O
. O

In O
unions O
where O
the O
central O
issues O
were O
confused O
, O
clear O
policy O
details O
- O
as O
on O

were O
decisively O
carried O

This O

are O
beginning O
to O
understand O
how O

why O
the O

provides O
a O
strong O

for O
a O
campaign O
against O
weak O

doubtful O
positions O

and O
for O
a O
consistent O

policy O

All O
recent O

show O
how O
correct O
the O
Scarborough B-GPE

were O

The O

Common I-ORG

, O
and O
the O
kite-flying O

Spain B-GPE
present O
a O
whole O
new O
proof O
that O
to O
abandon O
Scarborough B-GPE
is O
to O
expose O
Britain B-GPE
and O
her O

that O
Gaitskellism O

It O

, O
while O
accepting O
that O

the O

The O

no O

essay O
in O

by O
the O
L'Avventura B-WORK_OF_ART

Michelangelo B-PER
Antonioni I-PER
. O

The O
plain O
, O
sober O
manner O
of O
its O
style O
all O
the O
more O
tellingly O
points O
up O
not O
only O
the O
horror O
of O
the O
case O
itself O
, O
which O
floundered O
on O
to O
the O

a O
German- B-NORP

, O
but O
to O
the O
raree-show O
emotionalism O
and O
sensation-hunger O
of O
that O
era O
. O

Most O
of O
those O
who O
expound O
a O
theory O
of O
textual O
dislocation O
take O
it O
for O
granted O
that O
the O
Gospel B-WORK_OF_ART
was O
written O
entirely O
by O
one B-CARDINAL
author O
before O
the O
disturbance O
took O
place O
but O
a O
few O
leave O
it O
open O
to O
suppose O
that O
the O
original O
book O
had O
been O
revised O
even O
before O
the O
upheaval O
. O

The O
ingenuity O
of O
the O
theories O
is O
impressive O
and O
is O
the O
best O
argument O
against O
them O
. O

Thomas B-PER
Spreng I-PER
The O
one B-CARDINAL
real O
weakness O
of O
the O
Commentator's O
case O
is O
that O
, O
in O
common O
with O
all O
his O
colleagues O
, O
he O
has O
not O
, O
until O
now O
, O
been O
able O
to O
exhibit O
exactly O
how O
this O
enlargement O
was O
effected O
nor O
has O
he O
been O
able O
to O
explain O
the O
textual O
movements O
by O
showing O
that O
such O
changes O
are O
part O
of O
a O
simple O
and O
coherent O
plan O
. O

To O
understand O
how O
this O
is O
possible O
it O
is O
necessary O
to O
examine O
the O
text O
of O
the O
Gospel B-WORK_OF_ART
. O

THE O
Fourth B-WORK_OF_ART
Gospel I-WORK_OF_ART
was O
almost O
certainly O
written O
in O
Greek B-LANGUAGE
. O

A O
modern O
text O
of O
the O
Gospel B-WORK_OF_ART
represents O
the O
work O
of O
generations O
of O
scholars O
who O
have O
compared O
the O
many O
manu- O
scripts O
of O
John B-PER
and O
worked O
out O
the O
version O
which O
is O
most O
likely O
to O
have O
been O
the O
original O
wording O
. O

It O
is O
not O
possible O
to O
establish O
any O
one O
text O
with O
absolute O
precision O
. O

The O
bar O
was O
the O
commonest O
marking O
, O
but O
others O
were O
also O
used O
. O

Dots O
sometimes O
served O
in O
place O
of O
the O
bar O
, O
and O
there O
are O
cases O
where O
spacing O
is O
used O
as O
it O
is O
now O
used O
to O
mark O
a O
paragraph O
ending O
. O

Frequently O
paragraphos O
markings O
were O
omitted O
. O

C. B-PER

Professor O
E. B-PER
G. I-PER
Turner I-PER
is O
inclined O
to O
take O
the O
view O
that O
the O
original O
of O
the O
Gospel B-WORK_OF_ART
would O
be O
unmarked O
. O

The O
original O
of O
the O
Gospel B-WORK_OF_ART
, O
whether O
written O
on O
a O
roll O
or O
codex O
, O
whether O
paragraphed O
or O
not O
, O
would O
be O
laid O
out O
in O
columns O
. O

This O
is O
the O
invariable O
practice O
of O
ancient O
manuscripts O
. O

A O
common O
size O
of O
column O
would O
hold O
about B-CARDINAL
one I-CARDINAL
third I-CARDINAL
of O
a O
page O
of O
Souter's B-PER
print O
. O

To O
ridicule O
them O
only O
pushes O
them O
farther O
into O
themselves O
, O
so O
that O
they O
become O
unable O
to O
speak O
about O
it O
to O
anybody O
and O
the O
seeds O
of O
any O
amount O
of O
trouble O
are O
sown O
, O
the O
harvest O
of O
which O
may O
still O
be O
being O
reaped O
at O
forty B-CARDINAL
or O
fifty B-CARDINAL
. O

Far O
better O
to O
agree O
with O
a O
child O
that O
a O
particular O
situation O
is O
frightening O
, O
and O
then O
to O
face O
it O
together O
until O
the O
child O
can O
see O
how O
unnecessary O
its O
fears O
were O
. O

A O
little O
more O
honesty O
, O
even O
if O
one O
refrains O
from O
going O
into O
too O
many O
details O
, O
would O
help O
many O
a O
child O
to O
make O
a O
proper O
adjustment O
to O
life O
as O
it O
grows O
up O
. O

Let O
us O
look O
at O
Jesus B-PER
. O

We O
do O
not O
, O
I O
think O
, O
see O
there O
a O
life O
without O
fear O
. O

There O
are O
several O
instances O
where O
he O
seemed O
unable O
to O
go O
on O
. O

In O
Gethsemane B-FAC
He O
prayed O
that O
the O
cup O
should O
pass O
from O
Him O
. O

Jesus B-PER
shows O
us O
the O
way O
to O
face O
life O
. O

To O
see O
all O
the O
latent O
frightening O
possibilities O
and O
yet O
by O
facing O
them O
and O
knowing O
God O
is O
with O
us O
and O
that O
, O
with O
Him O
, O
there O
is O
nothing O
that O
can O
finally O
defeat O
us O
. O

More O
than O
that O
, O
that O
God O
has O
something O
important O
to O
do O
with O
our O
lives O
and O
that O
the O
nearer O
we O
get O
to O
Him O
, O
the O
stronger O
we O
become O
. O

Amen O
. O

MOST O
people O
would O
probably O
regard O
tiredness O
as O
a O
purely O
physical O
thing O
. O

The O
cure O
for O
which O
is O
sleep O
. O

This O
is O
only O
partly O
true O
. O

Many O
people O
wake O
up O
tired O
of O
a O
morning O
and O
no O
amount O
of O
rest O
seems O
to O
make O
any O
difference O
. O

Sleep O
, O
to O
be O
effective O
, O
must O
be O
of O
that O
child-like O
quality O
which O
comes O
from O
innocence O
. O

Even O
more O
simply O
, O
test O
your O
own O
reactions O
to O
different O
situations O
. O

There O
are O
some O
which O
bring O
on O
an O
almost O
immediate O
feeling O
of O
tiredness O
- O
such O
as O
when O
your O
wife O
mentions O
the O
washing-up O
- O
while O
others O
, O
if O
they O
refer O
to O
something O
you O
like O
doing O
, O
bring O
a O
veritable O
surge O
of O
energy O
. O

Many O
a O
girl O
who O
is O
' O
too O
tired O
to O
help O
mum O
' O
will O
later O
jump O
up O
with O
no O
apparent O
tiredness O
at O
all O
when O
her O
boy O
friend O
calls O
and O
go O
for O
a O
long O
walk O
. O

Nor O
is O
she O
necessarily O
being O
deceitful O
. O

She O
really O
did O
feel O
tired O
until O
the O
mind O
got O
the O
necessary O
injection O
of O
a O
fresh O
- O
and O
an O
attractive O
- O
interest O
! O

Tiredness O
has O
, O
therefore O
, O
as O
much O
to O
do O
with O
our O
mental O
state O
as O
with O
our O
physical O
exhaustion O
. O

A O
disturbed O
mind O
can O
bring O
the O
healthiest O
body O
to O
a O
sense O
of O
fatigue O
. O

They O
wonder O
why O
they O
get O
no O
rest O
at O
night O
, O
even O
if O
they O
do O
sleep O
. O

In O
the O
days O
when O
most O
people O
were O
born O
, O
lived O
and O
died O
within O
the O
boundaries O
of O
the O
village O
, O
it O
was O
not O
difficult O
for O
anybody O
to O
live O
a O
day O
at O
a O
time O
. O

Even O
those O
who O
held O
a O
high O
and O
responsible O
office O
lived O
in O
far O
greater O
simplicity O
than O
their O
successors O
. O

When O

even O
a O
Prime O

could O
go O

in O
blissful O
ignorance O
of O
what O
might O
be O
happening O
at O
the O

If O
we O
ever O

consider O
how O

time O
- O
we O
lose O
this O
way O
in O
the O
course O
of O
a O
day O
we O
would O
be O
staggered O
. O

Some O
of O
it O
is O
inevitable O
, O
and O
we O
do O
not O
want O
to O
become O
too O
pernickety O
. O

Nevertheless O
, O
we O
could O
all O
probably O
be O
a O
little O
more O
orderly O
for O
we O
so O
frequently O
just O
muddle O

be O

how O

with O
bold O

and O
rich O
colour O
, O
knitting O
, O
crochet O
and O
tatting O
in O
fine O

medium-weight O

give O
striking O
individuality O

many O
things O

and O
by O

produce O
something O
that O
reflects O
true O
creative O
talent O

The O
more O
delicate O
patterns O
and O
finer O
threads O
may O
be O
reserved O
to O
bring O
a O
light O
and O
lovely O
touch O
to O
personal O

insertion O
on O
a O
petticoat O
or O
blouse O
, O
a O

; O
these O
add O
a O
charming O
, O
feminine O
distinction O
that O
nothing O
else O
can O
give O
. O

Although O
we O
assess O
lace-making O
as O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
the O
feminine O
skills O
, O
a O
number O
of O
the O
well-loved O

that O
we O
follow O
today B-DATE

, O
in O

the O

For O
in O
the O
old O
order O
of O
things O
, O
men O
designed O
and O
worked O
lace O
as O
well O
as O
women O

special O
schools O
were O
set O
up O
to O
teach O
lace- O
making O
not O
only O
to O
young O
girls O
, O
but O
to O
little O
boys O
as O
well O
. O

Whole O
families O
made O
their O
livelihood O
by O
lace-making O
and O
consequently O
a O
folklore O
of O
song O
, O
festival O
and O
courtship O
grew O
up O
around O
the O
lace O
industry O
. O

During O
the B-DATE
sixteenth I-DATE
century I-DATE
a O
considerable O
amount O
of O
crochet O
was O
produced O
in O
the O
convents O
of O
Europe B-LOCATION
. O

Without O
doubt O
it O
was O
the O
nuns O
who O
carried O
the O
craft O
to O
Ireland B-GPE

There O
it O
was O
developed O
into O
quite O
an O
elaborate O
and O
distinctive O
form O
with O
rosettes O
, O
leaves O
and O
lace O

. O

During O
the O
time O
of O
Victoria B-PER
this O
gentle O

was O
greatly O

In O

hand-crocheted O

With O
a O

the O

The O
art O
of O

it O
is O

Unlike O

this O

Almost O
any O
available O

The O

The O
skeleton O

the O

this O
is O
the O
time O
to O

that O
nothing O

Ensure O
that O
the O
outside O

transom O
are O
equal O
on O
each O
side O

that O
the O

Next O
bevel O
the O
chines O
with O
a O
plane O
so O
that O

Cut O
out O

The O

to O

Carlyle B-PER

and O
, O
after O
mentioning O
that O
he O
had O
dined O
with O
Longfellow B-PER
told O
the O
sage O
a O
very O
funny O
story O
which O
made O
Carlyle B-PER
absolutely O
laugh O
; O
but O
all O
the O
Chelsea B-LOCATION
philosopher O
did O
in O
return O
was O
to O
ask O
if O
his O
guest O
would O
have O
a O
cup O
of O

! O

It O
was O
naturally O
a O
highly O
popular O
victory O
with O
the O
Londoners B-NORP
, O
but O
it O
brought O
heavy O
censure O
from O
nobles O

still O
believed O
that O

had O
a O
monopoly O

de B-PER
Vienne I-PER
avoided O
trouble O
at O

as O
cleverly O
as O
Du B-PER
Guesclin I-PER

Gaunt B-PER
was O
compelled O
to O
give O
up O
his O
search O
for O
an O
elusive O
foe O
, O
and O
, O
afraid O
to O
return O
home O
without O
something O
to O
show O
, O
he O
foolishly O
attempted O
to O
besiege O
the O
well-protected O
fortress O
of O
St B-GPE
Malo I-GPE
. O

This O
involved O
the O
dreary O
method O
of O
mining O
operations O
in O
which O
Gaunt B-PER
, O
under O
the O
Black B-PER
Prince I-PER
, O
had O
shown O
considerable O
skill O
at O
the O
siege O

It O
was O

I O
was O

I O

visited O
Oberammergau B-GPE

the O

The O
place O

were O
to O
play O
an O

For O
five B-DATE
years I-DATE
in O
succession O
till O
war O
broke O
out O
in O
1914 B-DATE

I O
spent O
my O

between O

Passion B-WORK_OF_ART

an O
interval O
of O
ten B-DATE
years I-DATE
, O
another O
play O
would O
be O
performed O
at O
the O
small O
theatre O
in O
the O
village O
, O
when O
new O
talent O
would O
be O
discovered O
and O
trained O
. O

First B-ORDINAL
of O
all O
simple O
part-songs O
: O
I O
found O
only O
one B-CARDINAL
member O
who O
had O
any O
idea O
of O
reading O
music O
. O

This O
was O
the O
village O
doctor O
who O
was O
an O
old O
school O
friend O
at O
Clifton B-GPE
. O

He O
could O
sustain O
the O
tenor O
part O
quite O
well O
and O
lead O
the O
others O
. O

As O
for O
basses O
and O
altos O
the O
conductor O
had O
to O
teach O
by O
singing O
the O
parts O
with O
them O
. O

It O
was O
very O
amusing O
, O
and O
by O
the O
end B-DATE
of I-DATE
a I-DATE
few I-DATE
months I-DATE
an O
enthusiastic O
choir O
of O
men O
and O
women O
could O
render O
simple O
part-singing O
tolerably O
well O
. O

Then O
we O
went O
to O
work O
on O
Coleridge B-PER
Taylor's I-PER
' O
Hiawatha's B-WORK_OF_ART
Wedding I-WORK_OF_ART
Feast I-WORK_OF_ART
. O

' O
Enthusiasm O
grew O
, O
and O
in O
a B-DATE
few I-DATE
more I-DATE
months I-DATE
we O
gave O
a O
concert O
at O
which O
the O
accompanist O
was O
the O
village O
schoolmaster O
, O
and O
the O
tenor O
solo O
' O
Onaway B-WORK_OF_ART

Friends O
from O
Limpsfield B-GPE
, O
in O
addition O
to O
the O
villagers O
, O
came O
up O
, O
and O
we O
were O
all O
happy O
. O

But O
what O
a O
change O
from O
the O
dear O
little O
old O
church O
at O
Tatsfield B-GPE
to O
the O
great O
modern O
church O
of O
St. B-FAC
Mark's I-FAC
at O
Purley B-GPE
. O

One O
felt O
at O
Tatsfield B-GPE
that O
, O
small O
as O
the O
church O
was O
, O
it O
had O
its O
own O
atmosphere O
, O
and O
for O
centuries B-DATE
had O
been O
a O
House O
of O
Prayer O
. O

I O
could O
not O
but O
feel O
the O
chilliness O
of O
the O
new O
church O
, O
beautiful O
as O
it O
was O
and O
is O
. O

When O
we O
had O
found O
a O
group O
of O
people O
who O
gladly O
co-operated O
, O
we O
made O
the O
little O
side O
chapel O
a O
place O
of O
daily O
prayer O
. O

I O
suggested O
to O
the O
congregation O
that O
it O
needed O
warming O
up O
by O
constant O
prayer O
and O
worship O
, O
and O
we O
found O
many O
to O
help O
. O

Gifts O
of O
candlesticks O
and O
stained-glass O
lancet O
windows O
- O
finally O
a O
new O
altar O
- O
helped O
to O
furnish O
the O
chapel O
as O
a O
little O
sanctuary O
for O
prayer O
and O
quiet O
. O

In O
time O
we O
received O
similar O
gifts O
for O
the O
High O
Altar O
, O
and O
large O
East O
and O
West O
windows O
. O

We O
gathered O
together O
a O
splendid O
Sunday B-DATE
afternoon B-TIME
service O
at O
the O
church O
, O
each O
child O
being O
given O
a O
number O
which O
, O
as O
they O
came O
into O
church O
, O
they O
could O
just O
whisper O
to O
the O
superintendent O
who O
filled O
in O
the O
regi- O
ster O
at O
her O
own O
home O
. O

Each O
child O
had O
a O
picture O
given O
them O
and O
the O
lesson O
was O
largely O
based O
on O
this O
. O

It O
was O
on O
a O
stamp O
which O
could O
be O
stuck O
in O
their O
book O
, O
and O
there O
was O
quite O
a O
clamour O
for O
back O
stamps O
if O
a O
child O
had O
to O
miss O
the O
Sunday B-EVENT
Church I-EVENT
from O
any O
cause O
It O
was O
quite O
amusing O
to O
see O
how O
much O
the O
children O
enjoyed O
the O
service O
, O
and O
I O
heard O
of O
parents O
or O
faithful O
nurses O
threaten O
any O
naughty O
child O
with O
the O
penalty O
of O
not O
being O
allowed O
to O
come O
to O
the O
Children's B-EVENT

on O
Sunday B-DATE

I O
hope O
the O
threat O
kept O
them O
good O
in O
the O
week B-DATE
, O
but O
anyway O
they O
were O
a O
most O
delightful O
lot O
, O
and O
it O
is O
a O
great O
joy O
to O
meet O
them O
now O
fifty B-DATE

afterwards O
when O
so O
many O
are O
parents O

From O
then O
till O
now O
the O
acquaintance O
ripened O
into O
a O

I O
have O
taken O
with O
me O
through O
all O
the O
many O
vicissitudes O
of O

on O

repeating O

Coming O
around O
the O
great O
mass O
of O
the O
Chateau B-FAC
Laurier I-FAC
, O
he O
braked O
to O
a O
screeching O
stop O
. O

A O
flying O
saucer O
was O
tilting O
and O
dipping O
over O
the O
War B-FAC
Memorial I-FAC
. O

There O
was O
a O
deep O
whirring O
sound O
, O
and O
a O
high-pitched O
hissing O
overtone O
that O
sang O
in O
his O
ears O
with O
an O
almost O
painful O
sharpness O
. O

He O
reversed O
and O
turned O
back O
on O
McKenzie B-FAC
Avenue I-FAC
. O

His O
whole O
attitude O
was O
a O
mixture O
of O
impatience O
pending O
an O
awaited O
communication O
and O
of O
a O
vague O
perplexity O
respecting O
his O
surroundings O
and O
the O
purpose O
he O
was O
to O
serve O
. O

Finally O
, O
being O
so O
obviously O
on O
their O
own O
, O
Heather B-PER
and O
Steve B-PER
tried O
to O
make O
themselves O
at O
home O

Steve B-PER
switched O
on O

systematically O
turned O

the O

They O
followed O
him O
to O
a O
city O
bus O
stop O
on O
Carling B-FAC
Avenue I-FAC
, O
where O
he O
waited O
. O

The O
bus O
stop O
was O
a O
deserted O
island O
on O
an O
empty O
street O
. O

But O
not O
for O
long O
, O
for O
soon O
pedestrians O
and O
cars O
flocked O
upon O
the O
Avenue B-FAC
from O
its O
many O
tributary O
streets O
. O

It O
might O
have O
been O
a O
normal O
business-day O
bustle O
, O
except O
for O
two B-CARDINAL
anomalies O

First B-ORDINAL
, O

was O

; O
and O
, O
second B-ORDINAL
, O
everyone O
walked O
, O
or O
drove O
, O
or O
waited O
as O
a O
person O
possessed O
of O
a O
single O
all-exclusive O
purpose O
. O

After O
a O
long O
wait O
a O
bus O
appeared O
and O
they O
followed O
the O
beaming O
Dan B-PER
aboard O
, O
taking O
seats O
some O
rows O
behind O
him O
. O

Steve B-PER
was O
beginning O
to O
find O
the O
stereotyped O
, O
flattish O
, O
happy O
faces O
very O
disconcerting O
; O
and O
looking O
at O
Heather B-PER
he O
found O
a O
welcome O

in O
her O
relatively O

Hostettler B-PER
One O
wondered O
if O
this O
greater O
awareness O
of O
the O
physical O
cosmos O
might O
with O
time O
instil O
the O
reverence O
which O
, O
on O
Earth B-LOCATION
, O
nature O
inspires O
, O
especially O
when O
one O
reflected O
that O
the O
rockets O
over O
which O
Mr. O
Peron's B-PER
Board B-ORG
presided O
had O
it O
in O
their O
power O
permanently O
to O
warp O
the O
solar O
system O
. O

True O
enough O
, O
such O
ultimate O
weapons O
had O
not O
been O
used O
in O
the O
last O
few O
wars O
, O
but O
it O
seemed O
very O
probable O
that O
they O
would O
be O
in O
the O
next O
one O
, O
Moon B-LOCATION
and O
her O
allies O
being O
more O
inferior O
than O
formerly O
to O
W.C.U. B-ORG
in O
the O
weapons O
pronounced O
conventional O
. O

Peron B-PER
entered O
, O
a O
large O
man O
, O
who O
had O
once O
been O
handsome O
but O
was O
now O
seedy-looking O
, O
a O
sufferer O
from O
stomach-ulcers O
. O

In O
the O
Back-Face O
tradition O
he O
wore O
, O
and O
kept O
on O
indoors O
, O
a O
fifty B-QUANTITY

Harry B-PER
was O
prepared O
for O
something O
unpleasant O
, O
for O
this O
was O
the O
Senator O
who O
had O
annoyed O
the O
United B-GPE
States I-GPE
by O
bragging O
how O
he O
had O
once O
won O
a O
trick O
from O
W.C.U. B-ORG
by O
threatening O
to O
loose O
off O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
his O
rockets O
( O
an O
admission O
which O
would O
scarcely O
help O
bluff O
to O
succeed O
the O
next O
time O
) O
and O
, O
lately O
, O
by O
saying O
that O
if O
Mo B-GPE
land-troops O
had O
to O
come O
to O
the O
aid O
of O
the O
O.G.O. B-ORG
contingent O
in O
the O
Panama B-GPE
region O
, O
But O
privately O
he O
turned O
out O
to O
be O
as O
friendly O
as O
Mr. O
Wise B-PER
the O
tube O
manufacturer O
, O
to O
have O
the O
same O
adolescent O
openness O
and O
freshness O
, O
though O
perhaps O
not O
the O
same O
maturity O
. O

One O
remembered O
that O
he O
was O
a O
lawyer O
by O
training O
, O
and O
suspected O
that O
the O
points O
he O
made O
so O
sharply O
in O
international O
politics O
were O
as O
abstract O
to O
him O
as O
those O
a O
lawyer O
makes O
in O
a O
court O
of O
law O
. O

The O
motive O
would O
be O
the O
same O
in O
both O
cases O
, O
to O
serve O
this O
home O
of O
his O
, O
in O
which O
his O
heart O
lay O
. O

Here O
the O
rocket O
man's O
charm O
was O
disarming O
. O

Yet O
when O
the O
time O
came O
to O
leave O
, O
Harry B-PER
felt O
as O
de- O
pressed O
as O
when O
he O
left O

If O
even O

only O
did O
what O
they O
had O
to O
do O
to O
get O
GO O
on O
an O
expan- O

left O
the O
sum-total O
of O
their O

their O
lunar O

earthly O
repercussions O
, O
to O
luck O
( O

to O
Moke B-PER

, O
there O
was O
a O
vacuum O
where O
there O
should O
be O
a O

of O

Stepping O
out O
in O
their O
white O

looked O
glad O
enough O
to O
be O
diverted O

however O
, O
with O
the O
single O
exception O
of O
one O
worried O
little O
man-student O
who O
kept O
getting O
out O

He O
looked O
as O
if O
nothing O
Moke B-PER
and O
his O
minions O
could O
do O
to O
him O
would O
ever O
make O
him O
GO O
; O
but O
the O
reason O
probably O
lay O
in O
elementary O
neurosis O
and O
not O
in O
some O
eruption O
from O
those O
deeper O
layers O
in O
the O
human O

of O
hills O
, O
canyons O
, O
buttes O
and O
malpais O
. O

" O
The O
mine-workings O
lie O
north O
of O
the O
town O
, O
" O
said O
Dan B-PER
. O

" O
If O
we O
head O
west O
we O
ought O
to O
cut O
the O
trail O
leading O
from O
Gilburg B-GPE
to O
the O
north O
. O

" O
So O
we O
swung O
west O
, O
making O
slow O
going O
over O
rough O
country O
, O
sliding O
on O
shale O
, O
climbing O
down O
into O
draws O
, O
circling O
a O
big O
mesa O
by O
a O
four B-QUANTITY
or I-QUANTITY
five I-QUANTITY
mile I-QUANTITY
valley O
, O
sandy-floored O
. O

It O
got O
hotter O
as O
the O
day O
wore O
on O
and O
we O
rested O
gratefully O
by O
a O
small O
creek O
where O
we O
watered O
the O
horses O
and O
drank O
enough O
to O
cure O
our O
thirst O
. O

An O
hour's B-TIME
riding O
brought O
us O
to O
a O
trail O
that O
we O
figured O
would O
lead O
to O
the O
miners' O
camp O
. O

We O
turned O
north O
into O
it O
and O
after O
about B-QUANTITY
four I-QUANTITY
miles I-QUANTITY
it O
led O
into O
a O
small O
canyon O
which O
opened O
out O
into O
a O
wide O
shallow O
draw O
. O

Here O
in O
a O
dried-up O
creek-bed O
we O
found O
the O
miners O
at O
work O
. O

They O
were O
scattered O
over O
a O
fairly O
wide O
area O
working O
singly O
or O
in O
pairs O
. O

We O
didn't O
approach O
unchallenged O
. O

Just O
short O
of O
the O
diggings O
there O
was O
a O
roughly-built O
shack O
and O
as O
we O
got O
near O
someone O
inside O
bawled O
out O
, O
" O
If O
you O
come O
any O
closer O
, O
I O
'll O
sure O
blow O
your O
whiskers O
off O
. O

" O
" O
Take O
it O
easy O
, O
mister O
, O
" O
I O
sang O
out O
. O

" O
We O
don't O
aim O
to O
come O
any O
closer O
and O
we O
've O
got O
no O
whiskers O
so O
as O
you O
can O
see O
. O

Just O
you O
go O
and O
tell O
Nick B-PER
Dowd I-PER
we O
've O
come O
to O
talk O
to O
him O
about O
what O
happened O
last B-TIME
night I-TIME
. O

" O
" O
Oh O
, O
" O
said O
the O
unseen O
guard O
. O

He O
blew O
a O
whistle O
then O
, O
loud O
and O
shrill O
. O

The O
gun O
barrel O
peeking O
out O
through O
a O
hole O
in O
the O
shack O
never O
wavered O
. O

We O
sat O
our O
horses O
, O
waiting O
. O

" O
Looks O
as O
though O
they O
're O
expecting O
trouble O
, O
" O
I O
said O
. O

" O
Where O
there O
's O
gold O
and O
women O
there O
's O
always O
trouble O
, O
" O
observed O
Dan B-PER
, O
shifting O
about O
in O
his O
saddle O
. O

He O
was O
never O
long O
on O
patience O
. O

Mr. O
Copthorne B-PER
was O
on O
dry O
land O
in O
a O
church O
outbuilding O
, O
but O
this O
was O
happening O
to O
him O
now O
. O

He O
saw O
himself O
as O
a O
sulky O
, O
ugly O
, O
malformed O
, O
repressed O
boy O
, O
then O
a O
young O
youth O
. O

He O
saw O
himself O
refusing O
baptism O
according O
to O
the O
sect O
his O
parents O
belonged O
to O
. O

Walking O
out O
of O
the O
chapel O
later O
on O
. O

Continuing O
on O
, O
his O
leaping O
mind O
flashed O
pictures O
of O
chi- O
canery O
and O
corruption O
, O
the O
growth O
of O
the O
dea- O
dly O
decadence O
and O
absorption O
in O
debase- O
ment O
and O
Satanic O
debauchery O
. O

He O
didn't O
know O
what O
to O
make O
of O
it O
, O
but O
it O
was O
Mr. O
Copthorne B-PER
all O
right O
. O

Perhaps O
he O
had O
been O
attending O
some O
kind O
of O
fancy O
dress O
do O
in O
London B-GPE
. O

Very O
strange O
his O
eyes O
looked O
. O

Mad O
, O
hunted O
eyes O
, O
as O
if O
the O
poor O
fellow O
had O
rocks O
in O
his O
head O
, O
so O
the O
verger O
described O
afterwards O
. O

" O
You O
're O
very O
early O
about O
, O
sir O
, O
" O
he O
said O
, O
trying O
to O
speak O
normally O
. O

All O
that O
was O
part O
of O
the O
past O
, O
she O
would O
put O
it O
behind O
her O
. O

She O
would O
never O
be O
jealous O
again O
, O
would O
even O
take O
Larry's B-PER
advice O
and O
look O
the O
other O
way O
if O
need O
be O
. O

" O
I O
say O
! O

" O
Gavin B-PER
was O
looking O
over O
her O
shoulder O
. O

" O
That O
's O
a O
pretty O
girl O
! O

" O
Gay B-PER
glanced O
behind O
her O
, O
" O
Isn't O
she O
lovely O
, O
she O
's O
French B-NORP
, O
a O
very O
well O
known O
model O
I O
believe O
. O

His O
behaviour O
was O
not O
only O
boorish O
and O
in O
the O
worst O
of O
taste O
but O
it O
was O
unkind O
beyond O
words O
. O

She O
fumbled O
with O
the O
cigarette O
packet O
which O
lay O
on O
the O
table O
not O
wanting O
to O
smoke O
but O
needing O
some O
action O
to O
help O
her O
control O
her O
feelings O
. O

" O
Come O
and O
dance O
, O
" O
Doc's B-PER
cheery O
voice O
came O
as O
a O
lifeline O
and O
Gay B-PER
got O
up O
quickly O
, O
mana- O
ging O
a O
smile O
. O

Doc B-PER
gave O
her O
hand O
a O
shake O
. O

" O
Wake O
up O
Gay B-PER
, O
and O
don't O
even O
contemplate O
throwing O
yourself O
away O
on O
a O
chap O
like O
that O
. O

You O
're O
a O
fine O
girl O
, O
intelligent O
, O
and O
pretty O
, O
and O
I O
had O
thought O
you O
were O
sensible O
too O
. O

Don't O
make O
a O
fool O
of O
yourself O
over O
someone O
who O
doesn't O
care O
two B-CARDINAL
jots O
for O
your O
feelings O
. O

If O
he O
behaves O
like O
this O
now O
what O
is O
your O
married O
life O
going O
to O
be O
like O
? O

Hell O
. O

" O
Doc B-PER
answered O
for O
her O
. O

" O
Just O
Hell O
. O

Never O
able O
to O
trust O
him O
out O
of O
your O
sight O
and O
having O
to O
put O
on O
a O
brave O
face O
and O
pretend O
that O
you O
don't O
mind O
whenever O
he O
flirts O
with O
another O
woman O
. O

He O
will O
you O
know O
, O
always O
, O
and O
you O
aren't O
the O
type O
who O
is O
tough O
enough O
to O
change O
him O
. O

" O
Now O
let O
him O
go O
and O
you O
won't O
have O
to O
wait O
long O
for O
the O
right O
man O
for O
you O
to O
come O
along O
. O

If O
I O
was O
thirty B-DATE
years I-DATE
younger O
and O
weren't O
married O
to O
the O
sweetest O
wife O
in O
the O
world O
I O
'd O
marry O
you O
myself O
. O

" O
Gay B-PER
laughed O
, O
Doc B-PER
was O
so O
kind O
and O
nice O
and O
she O
hoped O
that O
one B-CARDINAL
day O
she O
would O
be O
able O
to O
see O
the O
situation O
as O
it O
obviously O
appeared O
to O
everyone O
else O
. O

" O
I O
made O
it O
myself O
, O
" O
Gay B-PER
tried O
to O
speak O
normally O
. O

" O
If O
I O
were O
a O
tramp O
I O
would O
simply O
blow O
a O
feather O
, O
" O
she O
decided O
, O
rather O
envying O
the O
gentle- O
man O
of O
the O
road O
his O
freedom O
of O
decision O
, O
and O
wishing O
life O
would O
sometimes O
allow O
serious-minded O
women O
doctors O
to O
blow O
a O
feather O
and O
follow O
its O
airy O
directions O
accordingly O
. O

" O
If O
I O
were O
needing O
a O
job O
I O
'd O
go O
to O
London B-GPE
, O
of O
course O
, O
" O
she O
went O
on O
. O

She O
couldn't O
remember O
what O
they O
had O
been O
talking O
about O
or O
which O
' O
lark O
' O
she O
would O
have O
to O
stop O
, O
only O
that O
significant O
tiny O
word O
shouted O
into O
her O
very O
soul O
a O
horn O
of O
warning O
, O
and O
with O
it O
was O
coupled O
a O
disembodied O
fragment O
of O
information O
, O
which O
now O
took O
on O
an O
ominous O
significance O
: O
Nigel B-PER
had O
been O
seen O
in O
Farlingham B-GPE
on O
an O
occasion O
he O
had O
sworn O
he O
had O
been O
standing O
in O
for O
Luke B-PER
Parsons I-PER
at O
his O
surgery O
in O
Little B-GPE
Phelpham I-GPE
. O

No O
, O
he O
hadn't O
read O
it O
; O
Madame O
did O
all O
the O
reading O
. O

Lawrence B-PER
died O
in O
this O
very O
place O
. O

He O
used O
to O
come O
to O
Pierre's B-ORG
Bar I-ORG
again O
and O
again O
. O

No O
, O
he O
couldn't O
really O
remember O
him O
, O
he O
was O
one O
of O
the O
crowd O
. O

The O
sun O
came O
out O
; O
Mart B-PER
went O
shopping O
; O
I O
sat O
in O
the O
square O
reading O
the O
Patriote B-ORG
. O

There O
was O
a O
front-page O
rear-attack O
on O
de B-PER
Gaulle I-PER
, O
and O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
paper O
was O
given O
up O
to O
murders O
, O
apart O
for O
an O
outcry O
against O
a O
proposal O
to O
drop O
radio-active O
material O
into O
the O
Mediterranean B-LOCATION
between O
Corsica B-GPE
and O
St B-GPE
Raphael I-GPE
. O

All O
the O
murders O
were O
well O
documented O
and O
had O
the O
air O
of O
being O
written O
by O
an O
ingenious O
, O
but O
mad O
film O
director O
of O
the B-DATE
Thirties I-DATE
. O

They O
mostly O
occurred O
in O
lonely O
farm-houses O
. O

Monsieur O
H B-PER
, O
for O
instance O
, O
had O
been O
clubbed O
and O
throttled O
to O
death O
by O
his O
wife O
, O
children O
and O
father-in-law O
, O
after O
muddling O
up O
some O
sheep O
while O
the O
worse O
for O
drink O
. O

The O
family O
group O
then O
sat O
down O
for O
a O
late O
lunch O
before O
the O
father-in-law O
telephoned O
the O
police O
. O

Then O
again O
, O
Monsieur O
V B-PER
, O
owing O
to O
family O
troubles O
, O
had O
written O
to O
the O
local O
paper O
and O
the O
superintendent O
of O
police O
, O
informing O
them O
that O
he O
was O
on O
the O
point O
Monsieur O
V's B-PER
house O
was O
immediately O
surrounded O
by O
firemen O
and O
other O
officials O
, O
but O
there O
was O
no O
Monsieur O
V. B-PER
He O
telephoned O
a B-TIME
few I-TIME
minutes I-TIME
later I-TIME
from O
a O
nearby O
village O
, O
apologising O
for O
the O
trouble O
, O
but O
explaining O
that O
the O
walls O
were O
porous O
and O
the O
gas O
had O
escaped O
. O

General O
relief O
was O
expressed O
, O
but O
Monsieur O
V B-PER
( O
this O
was O
actually O
reported O
in O
the O
next O
issue O
) O
returned O
home O
and O
shot O
himself O
, O
leaving O
a O
note O
which O
again O
left O
his O
household O
goods O
Some O
grim O
comic O
relief O
was O
provided O
by O
an O
elderly O
farm O
labourer O
out O
for O
a O
shoot O
who O
hid O
himself O
in O
a O
bush O
and O
imitated O
a O
blackbird O
. O

Unfortunately O
a O
sporting O
taxi-driver O
was O
after O
this O
very O
bird O
and O
shot O
the O
farm- O
labourer O
in O
the O
face O
. O

All O
, O
however O
, O
ended O
well O
, O
reported O
the O
paper O
, O
since O
the O
pellets O
were O
easily O
removed O
and O
the O
labourer O
was O
able O
to O
return O
to O
work O
the B-TIME
same I-TIME
afternoon I-TIME
. O

We O
travelled O
down O
to O
Nice B-GPE
on O
the O
Lambretta B-PRODUCT
. O

You O
can O
free-wheel O
down O
a O
quarter B-CARDINAL
of O
the O
way O
. O

In O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
journey O
is O
a O
valley O
with O
a O
sea O
of O
vines O
and O
olives O
and O
beaches O
of O
earth O
pricked O
to O
blood O
by O
the O
hoe O
. O

Rising O
from O
the O
flecked O
sea O
are O
islands O
tapering O
to O
shipwrecked O
castles O
and O
towns O
, O
grey O
, O
rose-headed O
mariners O
clinging O
like O
limpets O
to O
the O
rock O
. O

There O
is O
a O
curd O
of O
morning B-TIME
smoke O
and O
a O
muffled O
bell O
taps O
the O
sky O
. O

Here O
we O
stopped O
, O
as O
in O
fine O
weather O
we O
always O
stopped O
. O

Down O
below O
is O
the O
village O
of O
Cagnes B-GPE
, O
but O
between O
are O
pockets O
of O
heat O
and O
cold O
like O
the O
hands O
of O
friends O
or O
strangers O
, O
and O
a O
flurry O
of O
early O
smells O
, O
the O
dark O
bosoms O
of O
beech O
and O
the O
thin O
pine O
fingers O
kissed O
by O
the O
sun O
. O

Then O
here O
was O
Nice B-GPE
, O
and O
the O
old O
holiday O
sea O
, O
blue O
as O
a O
new O
school O
exercise O
book O
. O

The O
same O
old O
Nice B-GPE
, O
creamy O
, O
vulgar O
, O
out O
of O
time O
, O
bitter-sweet O
with O
the O
ghosts O
of O
dead O
monarchs O
and O
brilliant O
prostitutes O
, O
edging O
past O
grubby O
grandeur O
to O
the O
old O
sleeping O
port O
. O

This O
, O
and O
Paris B-GPE
, O
were O
my O
ruined O
pavilions O
, O
and O
I O
could O
catch O
the O
taste O
of O
dead O
dreams O
on O
my O
tongue O
like O
spray O
. O

We O
parked O
the O
Lambretta B-PRODUCT
opposite O
the O
Negresco B-FAC
, O
and O
went O
to O
the O
beach O
to O
have O
a O
swim O
. O

Amazing O
bedlam O
rocked O
in O
our O
eyes O
. O

The O
sea O
boiled O
with O
waves O
, O
they O
galloped O
to O
the O
walls O
and O
spumed O
over O
the O
Promenade B-FAC
des I-FAC
Anglais I-FAC
. O

A O
huge O
crowd O
had O
collected O
. O

There O
were O
firemen O
and O
policemen O
and O
ambulances O
, O
and O
the O
eyes O
of O
the O
spectators O
were O
hard O
with O
disaster O
. O

They O
all O
had O
that O
neat O
look O
of O
Mediterranean B-LOCATION
people O
to O
whom O
nothing O
could O
ever O
happen O
, O
the O
chosen O
sane O
, O
the O
uncuckolded O
, O
unrobbed O
, O
sheltered O
from O
disease O
and O
accident O
by O
doctors O
, O
God O
and O
the O
municipality O
. O

Yet O
, O
at O
any O
time O
now O
, O
the O
bell O
would O
ring O
for O
them O
- O
the O
gilded O
love O
house O
, O
the O
mad O
grandmother O
or O
the O
bloody O
child O
at O
the O
